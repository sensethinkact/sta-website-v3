1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,699
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Charles Brian

2
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:11,609
Quinn, also known as CB Q, who
is the CEO and co founder of

3
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,839
green Z. Greens. He makes an
autonomous driving system for

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,129
commercial lawn mowers. In this
interview, we talk about greens

5
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,369
these autonomous mowing system,
how they've worked with

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,179
manufacturers to upfit their
system into commercial mowers,

7
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:33,299
how greens he does dogfooding
and about CPQ his experience

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,319
with bootstrapping, and raising
venture capital in startups.

9
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:42,689
This is the SENS think act
Podcast. I'm Audrow Nash. Thank

10
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,799
you to our founding sponsor,
open robotics. And now, here is

11
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:54,059
my conversation with CPQ. Hi,
CPQ Would you introduce

12
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:54,629
yourself?

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,599
Charles Brian Quinn: Hey, Audrow
Good to be here on the podcast.

14
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,069
I am CPQ I go by my initials
Charles Brian Quinn, and then

15
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:06,389
the co founder and CEO of green
Z. Greens he had our our big

16
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,479
mission is to free humans from
repetitive outdoor labor. And

17
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,239
we're starting in the green
industry. We have a product that

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,619
helps create self driving
commercial zero turn lawn

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,579
mowers. So we help big
landscaping crews that maintain

20
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,989
the largest crop in the United
States by square footage to help

21
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,119
them reduce their cost of labor,

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,600
Audrow Nash: the cost of living
grass by largest crop that is,

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,300
Charles Brian Quinn: if you
think about it, you know, I know

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,080
you've had great people on your
podcast that are doing farming

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,530
and but if you look at square
footage in terms I mean, grass

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,130
is a crop that the we maintain
across the United States in

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,490
terms of watering, cutting,
maintaining, cultivating, in

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,980
terms of square footage about
about 3x corn, which would be

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,210
the next and so there's people
who do that that industry, the

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,530
green industry we call it is
pretty big industry and not a

31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,730
lot of people want to sit stand
or push a mower for eight hours

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,370
in the hot sun, especially here
in Atlanta, Georgia, where we're

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,570
based. And all over the US
there's a shortage of labor. And

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,010
that translates as you know, in
supply and demand to higher sort

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,620
of demands on that and and
again, when when it doesn't

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,170
people don't want to do it. And
it's also dangerous, dirty,

37
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,840
repetitive, monotonous, you
know, things that we we all know

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,440
our robots are very good and
capable of and don't care about,

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,640
then it is probably a good place
for us to help supplement and

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,600
add robotic workers to these
crews, and our software that's

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,950
based on Ross does that.

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,580
Audrow Nash: Awesome. See, you
brought up a lot of things I

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,970
want to start. So first, you
kind of unrelated to your mower.

44
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,240
You mentioned there's a story
behind CPQ and why you prefer

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,570
that

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,910
Charles Brian Quinn: out there.
Yeah, I've just always gone by

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,820
my initials starting from high
school. And so it's even become

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,870
my little moniker, you know, on
every sort of side seq, which is

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,800
CPQ I used to even have a
license plate See viki.com And

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,950
since 99, so I've been gone for
a while. So yeah, and it's funny

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,200
and professionally to a lot of
people were like, hey, you know,

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,540
CPQ and they're like, who? And
it's like Charles and they're

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,380
like, oh, yeah, CBK it's kind of
a moniker that both

54
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,980
professionally and friendly. I
go by. So Andre Audrow were

55
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,630
close enough. Now you can call
me CPQ.

56
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,419
Audrow Nash: Funny. Okay, so now
tell me about the greens, the

57
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,099
mower or your setup?

58
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,589
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah,
absolutely. So we it's important

59
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:35,459
to note that what we do is we
are an automated driving sort of

60
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,099
system, right? We are basically
a software package that's

61
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,349
enabled by a set of, we call
them off the shelf sensors. As

62
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,729
you know, Robotics has gotten
very far in the past, Gosh,

63
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,199
20 3050 years, even more
recently with the introduction

64
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,429
of the Robotic Operating System.
And so with the standardization

65
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,829
these a lot of the reps and
things like you know, data

66
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,059
structures, like point clouds
and Ross enhancement proposals

67
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:06,689
are like being standards for the
Ross community. An easy one

68
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,989
would be like, hey, use meters
as opposed to, you know, inches,

69
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,149
right? Like, that's a very good
rep, one of the three I believe,

70
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,999
says, you know, there's some
good ones out there. And so with

71
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:19,499
all that, what we've found is
that the time is now to take

72
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:26,369
some of these sensors, like the
real sense camera, and use that

73
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,959
to basically do a function or
task and so green z, we build

74
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,009
software. That software is
enabled by a set of sensors and

75
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,919
we certify those sensors, we
call it being a robotic ready,

76
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,699
that's part of our robotic Ready
program. So we help these mowers

77
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,999
become robotic ready. And once
they have the sensors, they can

78
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:48,629
then run our software and our
software adds self driving. So,

79
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,959
we we are trying to like I said
reduce the cost of labor. So

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,069
when you think about autonomous
and the behaviors and things

81
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,969
that make something autonomous.
It is sort of self directed at x

82
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,419
You know, again, it's sensing
thinking, perceiving and acting

83
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,109
on the world. And so what we do
is we have a sensor stack that

84
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:11,429
does that for a very particular
part of the process that

85
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:15,419
landscapers do, and that these
mowers do, we call it sometimes

86
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,479
we call it cutting out the
middle. And that's kind of a

87
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,539
unique term that landscapers
kind of kind of resonates with.

88
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,089
Because when you get to a job
site, you know, there's a

89
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,569
certain set of tasks to do to
make, you know, the property

90
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,119
look beautiful or safe. If
you're, you know, mowing a

91
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,059
hospital facility that has a
helipad, you know, or right of

92
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:37,889
way for safety, or on roadways,
or industrial, you know, a lot,

93
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,169
a lot of safety reasons why you
want to keep that, that maintain

94
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,389
that property maintained, as
well as make it look beautiful,

95
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:45,509
then there's a tougher task you
do. And so our software helps

96
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,829
automate some of that. And,
again, by doing that we help

97
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:53,099
reduce the cost of labor for
those landscapers, which is why

98
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,099
they like our robotic workers,
but a lot of people assume we

99
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,039
have mowers and we don't,
they're some of our competitors,

100
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,399
who are wonderful, and happy to
mention them here. Companies

101
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,189
like Saif do are building a
automated mower, and that we

102
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,919
unfortunately do not we actually
build a a kit, basically. And we

103
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,939
do it at the factory. So we help
manufacturers and OEMs produce

104
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:21,869
self driving equipment that's
comes from the factory. Both

105
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:27,869
strategies, I think are noble.
And I think that it's tough to

106
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:30,449
compete. You know, especially
talk about John Deere, who I

107
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,989
know that one has been on your
podcast, it's tough to compete

108
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:36,089
with them, they produce lawn
equipment, I've been doing so

109
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,089
for hundreds of years. So
they've got a lot of learning

110
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:42,449
ahead of them and distribution
and all that stuff. But so what

111
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,459
we do is, again, add sensors,
and a sensor suite package and

112
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,429
our software that goes on these
existing commercial mowers to

113
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,769
add autonomy. Gotcha.

114
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,859
Yeah, it's it seems like a
clever approach, especially for

115
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:59,189
a startup to work with a company
that actually makes them ours,

116
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,729
and then kind of retrofit that
with your autonomous system.

117
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:08,039
Yeah. And the word like a lower
barrier than it is for sure. You

118
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,289
know, in talking about lower
barrier, when we first started,

119
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,709
we did try and like retrofit,
like posts sort of sale and so

120
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,099
we go get these mowers and, and
put all these things on them.

121
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,949
And I'll never forget the first
time we did it, everything

122
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,499
broke. And then we're like,
well, well, let's just make it

123
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,199
more robust. Right? And so we
tried, and what do you mean,

124
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,169
everything broke out, bro. You
know, like, when you think about

125
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,859
how these are used, I remember
the first demo, I saw ED, right,

126
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:34,319
who's the CEO, right
manufacturing, who is one of our

127
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,709
current manufacturing partners
that were partner with to bring

128
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,129
out our first product. I
remember seeing him demo, and

129
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,299
he's nonchalantly talking as
he's demoing. And he drives off

130
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:49,109
the curb, and then like drives
back on it and drives back on it

131
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:51,809
and off of it, and the mower is
just bouncing off the curb,

132
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,629
repeatedly. Yeah. And he puts
down to the deck and the deck,

133
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,349
like hits it and bumps up. And I
was like, oh my goodness, like

134
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:04,619
the amount of vibration
ruggedization required to keep

135
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:08,369
what we had originally had, we
just cert put these servers with

136
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:12,479
an eMag clutch to basically
actuate the the the left wheel

137
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,389
and the right wheel. And it
worked. But you know, it was

138
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,679
very fragile and delicate.
Absolutely. And you know, and

139
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:23,009
it's funny, like, it's not that
they're our end user customers

140
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,939
are rough on the equipment, it's
just that they have a job to do,

141
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:30,929
and not a lot of time to do it.
And so the you know, they're

142
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,719
they move fast, they roll over
the curb, they run it back into

143
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,249
the truck and are on to the next
site. So but retrofitting was

144
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:42,059
very difficult. And so we
immediately moved it from sort

145
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,019
of this post retrofit to at the
factory, that way we can use the

146
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,979
design principles, design it in
with the mower and get that

147
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:50,549
support.

148
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,570
Audrow Nash: How does that work?
It's like, so do you have to go

149
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,290
to the company and say, Hey, we
needed at this stage? And just

150
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,970
tell me a bit about that.
Because that's interesting.

151
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,699
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah. So
this is part of my consulting

152
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:06,239
background. You know, in a
previous life, I, we I helped

153
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,499
some of the big companies like
GE Lighting, and some other

154
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,159
companies do software that went
with hardware. And one of the

155
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,849
ways you do it is you go to the
factory, where that thing is

156
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,359
produced as close as possible to
the line. They call the assembly

157
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:26,129
line or manufacturing line. And
by doing the upfitting is what

158
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,869
we call it. You call it
retrofitting, but

159
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,090
Audrow Nash: it's up fitting
that way. You think about it,

160
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,840
like when you buy a guitar go
has it a little different than

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,760
retrofitting, because you're not
getting it all the way in. Like

162
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,760
you're not getting it from the
retailer where it's entirely set

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,860
up for the user. You're getting
it part of the way and then

164
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,720
you're adding things and
changing things. Yeah,

165
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,689
Charles Brian Quinn: we call it
a good way to look at it. If you

166
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:53,039
think about it. If you go to the
Let's assume you went to the

167
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,119
Ford dealer to go get a truck.
When you go they have some base

168
00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:00,359
models. You know the F 150 which
is the most popular are selling

169
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:04,739
truck and we have a couple of
Ford Yep. And if you go and you

170
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,659
say I want this one, they're
like, great. And you say, You

171
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,239
know what would be awesome,
those, I would love one with a V

172
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,719
eight, like turbo diesel, and
they go great, we don't have

173
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:16,529
any, but we could get that
upgrade package like we can do

174
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,479
that. And we get that from the
factory, like we'll put in that

175
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:20,909
order that it'll come down the
line, we'll put it on there for

176
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:24,329
you. And you can get even more
custom than that. But so that's

177
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:27,779
the idea is that this is a
feature, we call it a autonomous

178
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,229
mowing that we built that you
could up fit or upgrade and

179
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:35,189
order. And then it comes from
the factory. So what we've done

180
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:38,699
is work with, right. And I'm
working with a couple others

181
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,839
right now, that where we go and
we do that, that outfitting as

182
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,449
close to as I said the factory
as possible so that they come

183
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,359
off the line. And then when they
go to the you know, because

184
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,719
manufacturers are people who do
this, the end user customers buy

185
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,999
their equipment from outdoor
power equipment, so much like a

186
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,069
dealer. It's kind of like a
dealership, but for outdoor

187
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,679
power equipment. They sell these
things to do this kind of

188
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,519
activities. They have those
mowers already there. And then

189
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,349
they activate them just like I
guess OnStar or Sirius XM Radio,

190
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:10,319
if you've ever done that process
that's similar to us, except

191
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,979
you're doing software that does
autonomy, autonomous driving,

192
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,469
that's cool. Okay, is there.

193
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,510
Audrow Nash: So when you
approached the company that

194
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,170
makes the mower and you want to
add these custom features, I

195
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,830
assume they don't have like an
autonomous mower package. So I

196
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,500
assume you have to work with
them to do that.

197
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,640
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah. You
know, when we started the

198
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,300
company, we were sort of like
people were like, you know, we

199
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,270
already have robot mowers,
right. And so if you look at the

200
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,150
idea of a robot mower, those are
those little Roomba like

201
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,030
machines that and they've been
around since the 1970s. That

202
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,150
patent is has been there, I
think since Yeah. 70. And so you

203
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,940
put a boundary wire in the yard.
And so the big commercial mowers

204
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,550
were like, Hey, what is this?
You know, and how is this

205
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,100
different? And, you know, we had
to do a little bit of convincing

206
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,390
to tell them no, no, this is
self driving assisted sort of

207
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,120
like almost like Lane Assist.
And when we start using those

208
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,850
terms, they're like, oh, like my
new truck? has you know that

209
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,340
where it keeps them in the lane?
Probably? Yeah, it definitely

210
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,450
helped. And so we said, hey,
this is self driving, but for

211
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,270
these big commercial mowers,
where it takes over on part of

212
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,450
the operation, and they said,
well, that's not possible now is

213
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,810
it? And we said, well, look over
here, and we built prototypes,

214
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,200
and we did the retrofitting. And
we did all these things. And you

215
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,420
know, and I'll get back to that.
But that's actually the one of

216
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,660
the thesis of the business is
that we have been iterating

217
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,990
since we started and the term
iterate is very important to us.

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,760
It means do learn, improve, and
repeat. And the process of

219
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,090
iteration has helped us
tremendously. So I think it's,

220
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,490
it's interesting, as an
entrepreneur, I look back and

221
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,390
say, Oh, it's always been this
way. But I can guarantee you

222
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,060
that, you know, we've been
through several iterations where

223
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,510
we probably thought certain
things, and then we learned and

224
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,920
did and now the new reality is
that that is what we do. So, you

225
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,590
know, every entrepreneur will
tell you, Oh, yeah, I knew

226
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,610
everything to do with the
business. Yeah, they don't

227
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,350
actually what they do say is
they say, Well, we learned a

228
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,570
lot. So a lot of them talk
about, like learning through

229
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,990
failing, right, failing fast,
right? So we were doing a lot of

230
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,420
that in the beginning. And so
that's how we got there. To

231
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,200
answer your question, yes, when
we go to manufacture, that is,

232
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,100
you know, the, the now what we
do is we pitch and we tell them

233
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,560
about this robotic ready, which
is now been proven and

234
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,550
commercialized with a couple of
partners already. So there are

235
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,190
there are a few systems out
there, I would say that are

236
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,200
competitive. X mark is a big
manufacturer who makes Toro are

237
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,350
sorry, Toro, who owns X mark
and, and so they have one that

238
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,240
they've been working on for a
while. And then they even made

239
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,710
an acquisition in our space,
which was amazing. And I'm so

240
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,200
thankful for that, you know,
normally when, when, when, when

241
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,160
a competitor is acquired by a
big manufacturer, it's actually

242
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,500
an incredible opportunity. You
know, like a lot of companies

243
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,900
are like, Oh, that's scary,
because the big guy like has it

244
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,860
now. They slow down. No, isn't
that I mean, it's honestly that.

245
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,770
I mean, I live in a world of
abundance. And so yeah,

246
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,290
investors and everybody, and
there's always enough for

247
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,850
everybody to do. And so when
that happened precedent, well,

248
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,720
yeah, that any legitimizes you
and it also helps every other

249
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,060
manufacturer who doesn't have
that, like will pick up the

250
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,930
phone and say, Hey, I see that
you do this, right. If you know,

251
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,320
there are 46 outdoor power
manufacturers, and you may

252
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,950
actually be hearing some one of
them on the background.

253
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:32,070
Apologies. That's in our test
lab. But if one of those 46 Like

254
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,070
starts to think that they get
ahead, then the other 45 are

255
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,280
gonna be like, hey, and there
may be another one, you know, a

256
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,450
new one comes online, you know,
4648, you know, so you're saying

257
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,810
new companies, yeah, new
manufacturers or other sort of

258
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,990
entrants to the market. But I
think competition is wonderful.

259
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,340
It's definitely legitimising and
it's a rising tide lifts all

260
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,340
boats. I believe that and I
believe that, you know, my

261
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,970
entire life.

262
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,690
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it also seems
like it makes it It easy the

263
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,950
space grows. Yes, there is a
larger events in it so educate,

264
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,390
it's easier to harness all that.
Yeah, yeah. And parts may be

265
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,660
become more easily procured and

266
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,850
Charles Brian Quinn: things like
this. And then you get stuff

267
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,730
like, you know, like, maybe
standards are created, right

268
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,500
that are there to help you too,
as well.

269
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,740
Audrow Nash: Uh huh. So what is
your autonomous driving system?

270
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,530
What's it composed of? You
mentioned a lot of sensors. And

271
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,140
it probably has a big computer
with it. And it has some things

272
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,950
to interact with existing mower
hardware, but tell me a bit

273
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,370
about it.

274
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,070
Charles Brian Quinn: Sure. So
we're big fans of Ross. And

275
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,140
they're not like operating
systems. So and we're big fans

276
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,440
of open source. So while there
are parts of our stack, a few

277
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,380
nodes that we probably won't
open source, just because

278
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,660
they're not going to be useful
to the overall community.

279
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,830
specific use case exactly. I
see. But you know, if you look

280
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,280
at like, say, robot
localization, which we use, you

281
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,860
know, it's funny, we were out
there, I guess, couple years

282
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,220
ago, two years ago, and in the
field, and we were mowing for a

283
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,060
customer. And I'll remind me to
tell you about that becoming an

284
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,210
actual becoming the customer and
doing it ourselves. We still do

285
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,280
that. Now. We learned a lot. We
call that eating around dog

286
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,820
food. But I'll come back. Yeah.
But we were talking about robot

287
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,810
localization, we were using this
package and won one field, we

288
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,360
would be mowing, and all of a
sudden, we'd get to this one

289
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,860
area, and the mower would shoot
and say, Hey, I've got to head

290
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,570
50 miles that way, for my
waypoint, and we were like, that

291
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,740
is a bug. And we're like, that
is really weird. And whenever

292
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,780
flow error, it has to do with
UTM boundaries. Are you familiar

293
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,850
with, you know? So in,

294
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,460
Audrow Nash: I don't even know
what is UTM stands for? Yeah, so

295
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,610
I

296
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,550
Charles Brian Quinn: think it's
a universal time Merkin teal,

297
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,340
and we can look it up. I
apologize. But what it has to do

298
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,270
with is, latitude and longitude
are all straight lines. So you

299
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,400
know, if you're going on Google
Maps, you'll maybe notice that

300
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,390
you can get Google maps of like,
you know, it's a 33 or 90, and

301
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,710
it's all in degrees, right? So
you can do any location on the

302
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,150
planet, you can have a certain
it is a sphere band. So you got

303
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,600
so right, so why can't really
wrap a sphere in a rectangle,

304
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,900
right? There's some area that's
adjusting for that. Correct. So

305
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,860
we, we we most of the lot of
problem to run into, yeah,

306
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,100
mostly libraries take a area and
they'll do it in bounding boxes.

307
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
And so you'll be in a UTM
quadrant. And so once you're in

308
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,120
that quadrant, the the space
goes from sort of, you know, it

309
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,910
stays in that sort of area,
right. And then once you move

310
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,790
outside that boundary, that UTM
boundary, and there are like,

311
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,820
obviously 50 or so of those, you
know, as you talked about the

312
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,090
latitude longitude and the US, I
think there's like five or six

313
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,570
that you go across. Okay, don't
correct me if I'm wrong on that.

314
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,570
But there's quite a few. And we
just happened to be on it, that

315
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,780
one site happened to be on a UTM
boundary. So when it crossed

316
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,860
that boundary, it reset to the
other UTM, which was 50 miles

317
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,290
away. So anyway, we found that
bug, and it was great, we worked

318
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,280
with more to push up a PR and,
you know, and push it back to

319
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,980
the community. And now we're
about localization can go across

320
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,040
UTM boundaries. So big fans and
open source been doing in my

321
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,310
entire life. And we'd love to
keep doing that as long as as

322
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,020
long as it exists, which I hope
is forever. And and so you'd ask

323
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,600
us about our stack big fans of
robot localization. So we use a

324
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,390
lot of the base base stuff,
we're not trying to reinvent the

325
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,250
wheel. So standard cost maps,
we're big fans of Ross control.

326
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,520
We have hardware interfaces,
which really help us with, you

327
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,720
know, left wheel right wheel,
differential drive. What else do

328
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,270
we use? We use a lot of the
standard data. You know, I

329
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,060
Audrow Nash: guess they're
missing depth by using Ross one

330
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,960
or Ross two.

331
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,090
Charles Brian Quinn: We are
currently our current generation

332
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,290
stack is on Ross one. And I
think we're on melodic, and I

333
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,440
think we have a noetic running
around downstairs, that works

334
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,310
just perfectly fine. And so we
may upgrade our entire fleet to

335
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,570
that. And then Ross T we've
evaluated some of the packages

336
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,300
we're using aren't quite there
yet. And we've been working

337
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,970
closely with some of you guys at
open robotics, the Michael

338
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,650
Carroll who said, close we're
close. As soon as we are we

339
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,340
would love to upgrade and we can
even do that in field. So but

340
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,160
we're enjoying the Ross one
ecosystem. But yeah, so you

341
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,980
asked what's our sensor stack
and sort of package look like

342
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,130
but autonomous mowing is a suite
of Ross nodes that do a function

343
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,850
and that function is autonomous
mounting. So if you can imagine

344
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,140
our system feels like an
appliance. So it is a ruggedized

345
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,150
computer and I think you need to
go to our site. We're pretty

346
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,140
open with like everything we
use. It's an x86. I actually

347
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,440
just gave a talk at Ross con.
This last one on how to boot to

348
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,310
Ross and seven seconds where I
took this machine and really

349
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,900
minimize the colonel and use the
ubuntu LTS and kind of minimize

350
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,350
that install with the precede to
make it very minimize it boots

351
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,680
up very quickly. Super fast. And
I and just go straight into

352
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,640
Ross, using System D, which
we're big fans of, we like a lot

353
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,200
of the Unix stuff. And so where
there's a lot of custom stuff we

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,430
don't, we're sort of not big
fans of it. So yeah, we use a

355
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,760
lot of like sort of trusted
stuff like system D networking

356
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,570
and open VPN and some of the
sort of standard standard stuff

357
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,800
that's been around for a while.
It's very modular, extremely big

358
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,070
fans of node based, you know,
single responsibility, tiny

359
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,520
things that do one thing very,
very well, liberal and the input

360
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,300
that they accept, very specific
in the output that they do. And

361
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,420
so a lot of design principles
for software that we like about

362
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,210
Ross. And our stack does that
very, very well. It also

363
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
interfaces with a web app that
we've built, that our customers

364
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,450
love. And that's built in Ruby
on Rails, which we love, and is

365
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,820
probably the best for doing
rapid web application

366
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,730
development. And, you know,
there's a bunch of stuff behind

367
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,880
the scenes there. But I won't go
into all the details. But all

368
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,610
that does a very specific
function, and that is

369
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,450
landscapers by our product, they
take the motor out, they press

370
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,440
map, they mow a area of the
area, they want it to sort of

371
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,340
finish the job for them, they
press go on a little remote, and

372
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,580
it basically just finishes and
Stripe still fills in

373
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,970
everything. So they do the
border. And from there, you fill

374
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,860
it in autonomously, exactly.

375
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:25,619
Audrow Nash: Okay. Let's see. So
for all of the what kind of

376
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:31,589
sensors are you using for this
whole? So when you map it? Is

377
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:35,939
that are using GPS? Or? Yeah, so
what kind of thing are using?

378
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,430
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah, so
I'll start with control and get

379
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,460
all the way sort of there. It
starts with control. And in

380
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,140
order to be, you know, I have a
theory about robotics that a lot

381
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,810
of people when they envision
robots, they think of the Willow

382
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,980
Garage, sort of PR to like, has
to be humanoid. But in reality,

383
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,270
you know, robots are in robotics
as a way to I think automate and

384
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,300
customize what would normally be
considered a human level task.

385
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,850
And so there's a lot of ways you
can do it. When you think about

386
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,780
self driving cars, they are in
in terms, sort of a robotics. So

387
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,440
the first thing you have to do
is get good control. And so what

388
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,170
we do is with let we need
control of left wheel, right

389
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,150
wheel, because these are
differential drive, and a lot of

390
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,520
them have caster wheels on the
front. So they while they have

391
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,850
bias, they don't really matter
and are controlled. And so we

392
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,950
start with left wheel and right
wheel control. And we've been

393
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,950
able to do that with a drive by
wire system. And so that starts

394
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,910
with with Ross control and
having a canvas adapter. And so

395
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,950
we use can which is on you know,
very

396
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,590
Audrow Nash: cool was on his
cannon? Oh, yeah,

397
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,300
Charles Brian Quinn: I think
it's already gonna do you know

398
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,760
it right. What is it? It's the
automotive protocol. Right?

399
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,450
Yeah,

400
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,460
Audrow Nash: I know, it is the
automotive protocol. I don't

401
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,550
know

402
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,890
Charles Brian Quinn: what
exactly stands for. But it is a

403
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,350
protocol, we could probably look
up the acronym. But it is a

404
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,710
protocol that a lot of cars use.
And it's very small, it's very

405
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,060
high speed. And good for
redundancy. Yes, it's built in.

406
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,580
And so we have that can
interface layer that allows us

407
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,280
to left wheel right wheel. So
once we have that we then need

408
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,750
to read. So we use encoders.
This standard Hall Effect sensor

409
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,060
encoders. And on our electric
platform, we can read that

410
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,840
straight from the wheel itself,
they have encoders built in. And

411
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,540
the reason you'll need to know
that is no velocity. And so when

412
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,020
you're able

413
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,110
Audrow Nash: to say hey, you do
your own mapping with this,

414
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,540
you're not you're not
necessarily using GPS, you're

415
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,780
using odometry, large, right,
and then maybe sensors and

416
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,140
things.

417
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,840
Charles Brian Quinn: So you're
exactly right. So we're slowing

418
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,740
down for

419
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,410
Audrow Nash: just a second just
to speak about a hall effect

420
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,900
sensor. So it's a magnetic
sensor, and you can count the

421
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,040
ticks as a wheel spins. So maybe
you have one magnets, or you

422
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,460
could have a bunch of magnets
and you can count do you do?

423
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,760
What's it called where they're
90 degrees out of phase? If you

424
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,430
have to, let's say that you can
figure out the directionality.

425
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,070
Yes, that's exactly correct.
Because one way it's traveling

426
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,010
90 degrees over to get the next
bump. And one way it's traveling

427
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,760
270 degrees or three fourths of
a rotation or three fourths of a

428
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,690
phase? I guess

429
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,340
Charles Brian Quinn: that's
correct. And you can get some

430
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,310
telephones have the gear
backwards. Exactly. So they have

431
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,040
gear teeth that they're reading.
And so then if you know, the

432
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,520
tick count, you know, and you
could just do the math to say

433
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,630
how many wheels and velocity?
Yeah, so yeah, exactly.

434
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,210
Audrow Nash: And you were saying
sensor fusion? Because if you're

435
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,120
using raw odometry, like just
seeing how many times your

436
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,870
wheels spin, there's slip and
all sorts of things that all

437
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,950
accumulate as errors. So you're
dealing with that through some

438
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,030
sort of sensor fusion?

439
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,070
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah, so
you're exactly right. When we

440
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,240
first started, if you just use
our DOM, or odometry, on a very

441
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,170
nice platform that doesn't have
a lot of slip, you go out, you

442
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,130
turn left, you turn, right, you
turn again, you get that square

443
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,950
and in you know what'll end up
happening is you'll be like this

444
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,130
right? And it won't be
distorting. And what I'm saying

445
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,890
is you can't for those who can't
see, it's like a you know,

446
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,010
unconnected square right?
Because of the slip. And so what

447
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,690
we do is we fuse that with an
IMU. And so we have a high grade

448
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,970
IMU we've evaluated many, many
many IMU use small ones we liked

449
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
I happen to like some of the
vector NAB stuff because it's

450
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,410
nocturnally calibrated alias
that for the gyroscope. So they

451
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,920
don't even notice all of the
sensor data from it. But yes, we

452
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,740
do fuse a lot of the components
from it. Yeah, the gyroscope,

453
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,180
which tells it which direction
you're facing? Yep. Yeah. So I

454
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,300
did something like this in grad
school, it was like some course

455
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,750
where you use the sensor fusion
of the inertial measurement

456
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,170
unit, and the odometry. And it
gets much more accurate, which

457
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,610
is pretty amazing. So you're
doing now we fuse that along

458
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:38,340
with GPS, and we do high
accuracy GPS, we have the

459
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,650
ability to run on standard GPS,
but we prefer and for some of

460
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,840
our customers for the straight
lines and tracking that they

461
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,080
want to do. And a lot of the
fields that we are we have RTK

462
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,210
GPS, and are just gonna have
real time kinematic. And what

463
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,110
that means is, is if you think
about normal EPA accurate, yes.

464
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,690
And I think you've had people in
your podcast talk about this

465
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,250
before. But

466
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,710
Audrow Nash: you may not have
this podcast, previous one, I

467
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,300
think so yeah, you get crazy.

468
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,900
Charles Brian Quinn: You get
correction data. So you can get

469
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,220
a very accurate centimeter
level. So we fuse all that now I

470
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,100
can tell you that our sensor
fusion is pretty heavily biased

471
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,550
towards the RTK GPS, because the
quality of it is just super

472
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,930
accurate. Those are

473
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,570
Audrow Nash: so if I remember
correctly, and maybe the price

474
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,650
has come down, those are like
$20,000, or something to get a

475
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,230
good RTK GPS isn't correct

476
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,629
Charles Brian Quinn: or and we
first started down, it has come

477
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:36,239
down quite a bit. And when we
first started exciting, I

478
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:39,599
remember we were using an RTK
setup that had a base station.

479
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,899
And you're right, it was 1000s
of dollars for this one and

480
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:46,439
1000s for the one on the
machine. And gosh, just

481
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,589
recently, I saw that. And a lot
of it's been enabled by a

482
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:53,429
company called ublox. And
essentially, they have a chipset

483
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:58,349
called the F nine and F nine P
and that has taken the cost down

484
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:03,509
to in saying I think we just got
another sensor for I'll admit

485
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:07,289
it, I think we just got our most
recent RTK for like 129 bucks,

486
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,189
and I'm like, Oh my God, that's
crazy. And so the real the real

487
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:14,069
kicker, though is that the data,
Correctional Service really

488
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:16,709
matters. And that's where you're
seeing a lot of the innovation.

489
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,919
So there's a service out there
called SEF. There's service out

490
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,039
there called Point perfect, that
provides what we call n trip,

491
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:26,129
which is I forget what that
stands for, I think it's a

492
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:29,909
network transport protocol. And
so instead of having a base

493
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:32,309
station, what they do is they're
basically like a cellphone

494
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:35,669
network and every 50 kilometers
from the, you know, from certain

495
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,299
high density areas, they put
their own base station, they

496
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,589
calibrate it with other sort of
known areas. And then they can

497
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:46,619
send out that correctional data
over the Internet. And so you

498
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:50,369
don't have to have a base
station. That's nominal. And you

499
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:54,119
already have that data. It's
gotten really good, low latency,

500
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,529
you know, super high
availability. And with that

501
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:01,349
correctional data, it's been
really good and very good for

502
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,039
our business.

503
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,979
Audrow Nash: Do you ever? I
don't know with RTK GPS, but do

504
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,279
you ever run into situations
where you're mowing a field and

505
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,709
it doesn't have good GPS
coverage? Absolutely.

506
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,320
Charles Brian Quinn: So we've
had to design a lot around that.

507
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,400
And what happens is in
localization, at least in the

508
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,940
way we've done it, which is the
best practices, you know, by you

509
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,760
know, roboticist, you've done
this before, you have what's

510
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,930
called continuous and you have
your discrete, and I think I'm

511
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,470
getting that right. But in
continuous, you've got things

512
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,200
like, that are just going
continuously. And so that's

513
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,940
Audrow Nash: odometry. And
that's the wheels spinning,

514
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,370
okay? And knowing how far they
spend, right? In

515
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,439
Charles Brian Quinn: your
discrete, you can have jumps,

516
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:47,819
right? And so, in a good
localization system, what will

517
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,079
happen is, when you have when
your discrete jumps, like, let's

518
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,339
say your GPS shifts, and you
know, it runs out or it's

519
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:58,469
there's no connectivity, or
whatever, and it says, oh, you

520
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,749
know, I really thought you were
here and you're moving along and

521
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:04,919
boom, you're over here. A good
localization system will go, I

522
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,489
don't think so I, I had all this
momentum in my ETF sort of

523
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:11,489
saying bias that I was saying I
was going five meters a second

524
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,659
this way. Yet. Now when when you
say me, I'm over here, I'm gonna

525
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,749
ignore that and and yet back in.

526
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,019
Audrow Nash: So you use
probabilistic methods like an

527
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:26,039
extended Kalman filter and ukef,
as you were saying, exactly. And

528
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,249
so what that does is you have a
pretty good idea, like you have

529
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:32,879
a probability distribution that
says I'm most likely here. And

530
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:35,969
if you get some information that
says, I'm way over here, it's

531
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,249
like, well, it's probably not
very likely it takes that

532
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:42,299
information into account. And
then it adjusts its belief

533
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,749
accordingly, but if you tune it
in a way, it probably won't

534
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:48,569
listen to that very hard, or
very significantly.

535
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,939
Charles Brian Quinn: And what
ends up happening the thing

536
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:56,669
that's worse actually is not GPS
going out, per se, it's the

537
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,999
thing that will mess you up. Is
it is it changing and you should

538
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:04,169
between a high accuracy and a
low accuracy. So we've actually

539
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,679
designed our system such that
when it starts, if you get a

540
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,489
high accuracy fix, like we go,
and we're like, great. And then

541
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:14,669
if we lose it, which has
happened, you go down, you know,

542
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:17,309
big hill and go down, and
there's no coverage down here.

543
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,729
And it just, it's starting to go
out. If the system loses it, the

544
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:23,609
mower will pause, our software
will pause and say, hey,

545
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:28,289
something's up. seconds ago was
the last time I got a high

546
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:31,589
accuracy. And so the mower
pauses, and it'll kind of wait,

547
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:34,349
maybe it's just like fluid,
maybe it's a fluke or something.

548
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:36,749
And so sometimes the motor will
just kick back and start going,

549
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:40,259
it'll get that fixed back. But
if it can't, you know, there is

550
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:42,719
a chance for the operator, at
least with the mobile interface

551
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,209
that we've built to say, you
know, what, go ahead and turn

552
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,819
off the low accuracy or high
accuracy, and there may be a

553
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:51,239
small shift in the map. And so
it's not enough to make a huge

554
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:54,839
difference based on what we've
learned. But it is enough that

555
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,569
you could say, hey, just turn it
off. Because what what's, what

556
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,939
stinks is how, again, going in
between them, and it's

557
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:02,699
constantly shifting is what will
mess you up. But again, yeah,

558
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:06,689
sensor fusion, what we do think
about it, like we basically use

559
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,779
our coordinate system in Ross,
right? You have 00, right, which

560
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,569
is where a robot starts, and
then we record right. And so

561
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,389
we're using all this data to
determine where we think, you

562
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:18,539
know, the next point is, you
know, on the map and coordinate

563
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,299
space, and we're using all these
other systems. So the robot

564
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,419
doesn't think it's at, you know,
lat launch. It's using lat lodge

565
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,229
as a data point,

566
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,960
Audrow Nash: internal coordinate
system. Yeah. Yeah, you

567
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,500
transform it into your primary
reference system.

568
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,780
Charles Brian Quinn: And as all
robotics is, right, it's a

569
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,100
transform series of sensors all
connected with a universal

570
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,390
descriptive robot format. You
RDF you. And that's, we love you

571
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,290
RDF. We use this a lot as well,
because it's all just transforms

572
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:46,890
all the way down.

573
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,730
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Funny. So if
you so for your robot, where

574
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,460
you're driving it, and you
haven't heard it, and 50 seconds

575
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,280
from the GPS, which is your
really good source of

576
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,090
information for driving it
around. Do you have so if you're

577
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,420
using a probabilistic way of
reasoning about where it is,

578
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,140
does that uncertainty just it
keeps, so it received one good

579
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,570
information? And then it drives
using odometry? And yeah, using

580
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,250
odometry. And then, so the
uncertainty continues to grow as

581
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,430
it goes. And at some point, you
say, This is too uncertain, I'm

582
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,030
gonna wait for a better GPS, or
then you trigger this has have

583
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,660
the operators switch the GPS,
from high to low, or whatever it

584
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,170
might be.

585
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,600
Charles Brian Quinn: Generally,
I don't know the, the correct

586
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,300
answer to this. But what's
interesting is, I think, when

587
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,830
you think about cars, and how
they drive so far, you know,

588
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,290
that that where that bias could
really go, and you talked about

589
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,270
even going through UTM
boundaries and things like that,

590
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,510
that's where a lot of that will
grow. In the areas that we're

591
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,860
doing even like, like the the
large acreage, even, it's enough

592
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,150
to do a full day of mowing, and
you're totally okay, running on

593
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,110
that same localization and, and
being able to cover that field.

594
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,960
And we're good enough, then we
haven't run into really any of

595
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,300
those. And what's interesting
is, at that, that's great, you

596
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,450
reset, you turn off, you go to
the next site you turn back on.

597
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,180
And so since it's not long
running, like the second truck,

598
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,960
or a truck going across the US
and really accumulating so much

599
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,950
bias, we've been okay. Knock,
yeah, so the error doesn't stack

600
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,950
up that significantly and so
sign I'm aware of.

601
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,110
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Okay, so
then, what? What other sensors

602
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,840
do you have? So you have
odometry, you have some depth

603
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:39,210
cameras and things like this?
What else? So or how is the how

604
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,560
are the depth cameras use

605
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,780
Charles Brian Quinn: your
perception pipeline we're really

606
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,880
proud of we are. I'm a big fan
of AI and ML, and I think it's

607
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,210
gonna happen. But I'm actually
not, we're not using it, I

608
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,930
believe it's gonna happen. I
believe that some of the AI and

609
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,070
ML modeling and some of the
training and the networks that

610
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,880
are being developed out there
are going to revolutionize a lot

611
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,340
of the tasks that we have to do
algorithmically or

612
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,170
programmatically. And I truly
believe that. However, I think

613
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,490
that right now, it's a bit of a
black box approach. And you

614
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,760
know, that the the amount of
data required to really train it

615
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,350
up for what we would consider to
be good enough, prohibitive. It

616
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,400
is and,

617
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:26,129
Audrow Nash: and so we need like
a million examples of someone

618
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:27,689
walking in front of it or
something

619
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,400
Charles Brian Quinn: like that.
And everybody corrects me says,

620
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,530
Oh, we've got synthetic data.
And I'm like, Well, you know,

621
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,050
synthetic data is synthetic
data, like you can only like

622
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,470
change the color of a, you know,
seven times and it doesn't

623
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,670
really add that much.

624
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,329
Audrow Nash: In distribution
mismatches between simulated

625
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:45,569
data and real data are huge a
lot of times,

626
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,700
Charles Brian Quinn: I mean, I
know because we've been mowing

627
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,070
in the field and you'd be
surprised that the stuff we

628
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,990
really ever Yeah. So what we've
done is we've taken a really, I

629
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,090
guess, a pretty unique and this
goes back to our design

630
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,110
principles approach of really
keeping it simple. And so what

631
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,100
we have is a lightning fast C++
pipeline that does, you know,

632
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,970
ransack, which is stands for I
don't, I can't remember random

633
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:13,050
sampling. Yes. And what it does
is it tries to consensus, right?

634
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,640
So it tries to find the ground
plane. And, and then anything

635
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,690
above the ground plane is an
obstacle. So, this is not like

636
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,910
we're trying to classify and say
You said, so I, the way I

637
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,130
described our customers is
they're like, visit detect, like

638
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,860
kids. And I'm like, you know, it
does not make a distinction

639
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,550
between a garden gnome and a
kid. If it sees something above

640
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,960
the ground plane, it's going to
stop

641
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,240
Audrow Nash: it'll success to go
back slightly for ransack and

642
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,180
talk about a little bit about
that. So you, you have your

643
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,930
depth camera, your depth camera
points over the ground. And then

644
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,570
what you're going to do is check
a bunch of, it's going to give

645
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,580
you points at different depths,
kind of. So from this, you're

646
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:59,040
going to try to fit with a math
equation, a plane on that. So a

647
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,340
2d surface, and the one that
matches the majority of the

648
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,340
points is the one you're gonna
select. And that's it's a fast

649
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,940
algorithm. Yeah, so the thing
that's on top of that are

650
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,000
deviating from it, you're like,
This is something thing. Yeah,

651
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,870
is what I understand.

652
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,580
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah, and
not to get into all the details,

653
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,640
but we have some special fun
sauce, we do around line fit,

654
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,970
and some of the other stuff on
stuff to make it really fast and

655
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,380
accurate. And, and then again,
all that's translated into just

656
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,310
a standard cost map. And the
cost map would be, hey, you

657
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,640
know, a, when they see something
that is a, you know, tree or

658
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,670
vertical plane or anything above
that, that that is not part of

659
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,680
that, that that surface, then it
says, Hey, I can't go there. And

660
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,070
so it creates a very large
infinite cost map, you know, to

661
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,310
say, like, kind of out there.
Yeah, exactly.

662
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,820
Audrow Nash: Okay, how do you
deal with like? So I imagine

663
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,840
like the way you want to handle
a kid, in close distance to the

664
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,380
mower, and the way you want to
handle a pole would be very

665
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,160
different. How do you, like if
I, if there's poles in my lawn,

666
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,210
or in my field here,

667
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,040
Charles Brian Quinn: you want to
go around them? Whereas the

668
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,370
other kids want to stop? Right?
Yeah, what's interesting is when

669
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,270
you think about, and this is
natural as as humans to sort of

670
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,510
say, like, let's solve the
entire domain, right, like,

671
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,180
let's do it just like a human
would. And what's interesting

672
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,420
is, having developed this
company, you know, from

673
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,810
iterative and from these basis
is sort of like, how do I solve

674
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,200
the first immediate problem,
which is a job to be done, and

675
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,670
get as far as you can get, as
far as

676
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,150
Audrow Nash: that iterating,
you're speaking about exactly,

677
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,890
Charles Brian Quinn: is that
when you get when you actually

678
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,650
talk to customers? They're like,
Do you know what they're like,

679
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,520
I'm good at going around things.
Like, you know, by the way,

680
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,910
like, I can go right around a
tree, I know where the the

681
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,360
brushes, or the pine straw or
whatever it is, or the roots

682
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,320
there like I can do that. What I
need help with is just the sort

683
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,220
of big valueless. Exactly. And
so what we've done is we've,

684
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,850
we've built our system is such
that it is made for those open

685
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,950
areas. And so when a lot of
people do that, they're like,

686
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,740
Well, I probably can't use it.
Because you know, I, you know,

687
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,860
I, you know, I do this one that
just has trees everywhere. And

688
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,250
we're like, great. The good news
is the mower still works like

689
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,370
you normally do. Yeah, you know,
like, I don't turn on cruise

690
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,280
control, the moment I get out of
my driveway, I hope you don't

691
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,850
either. I only do it when it
starts to get really repetitive

692
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,310
and boring. And I'm like, I'm on
the highway, let me turn on

693
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,370
cruise control. And so it's the
same functionality that we've

694
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,960
developed, right? Yeah,

695
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,300
Audrow Nash: cruise control is a
very good metaphor for those.

696
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,530
Yeah, see, because you use it
when you have a spot that's

697
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,590
incredibly monotonous. Like,
it's just this big, open thing

698
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,760
that's going to take a bunch of
passes. And thus, a big open

699
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,910
field, that's going to take a
lot of back and forth. And so

700
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,730
that's when you use it. But for
the highly custom stuff, like if

701
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,580
you had a bunch of poles or
trees to go around, in which

702
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:59,760
case you don't engage cruise
control, you keep the robot. And

703
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,880
so your systems are made so that
a human operator can just jump

704
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,060
on it. Like you're not modifying
the spot where the human works,

705
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,280
Charles Brian Quinn: right. And
that's been very critical. Even

706
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,640
when when we first developed it,
I remember a customer early on

707
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,080
telling me, you know, Hey, your
system may be great and may

708
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,740
never break, but this is my
livelihood. So there always

709
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,290
needs to be a way to disconnect.
And so that's one of the

710
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,510
features we design and the
robotic ready. If you look at

711
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,690
our website, there's a switch
from manual to autonomous and,

712
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,930
you know, it's funny, you and I
both know that it's probably not

713
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,620
needed in the future at one
point. But it is a physical

714
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,430
safety blanket type thing when
you do this, the entire system

715
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,730
is cut off, that could have
autonomous control. And so

716
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,730
there's no way for the system to
take over and sort of issue

717
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,450
commands to the wheels and
that's a very fun thing for our

718
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,390
customers that are relieving,
you know a safety blanket that

719
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,020
they like, and it's also a
productivity thing like they can

720
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,840
always sort of say, and when you
say jump on to I want to be

721
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,000
careful to say that that when
the motor is going autonomous

722
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,550
because we have sort of 360
cameras, if you run up to it,

723
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,090
even from the back, it'll stop.
If you even somehow were able to

724
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,360
get up and dodge it or whatever,
be a ninja. And it wasn't

725
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,880
meaning this. But yeah, but it's
fun to talk about, like, if you

726
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,780
were to jump on the back, a lot
of the mowers have a thing, you

727
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,690
stand on a platform operator
presence, if you get on that,

728
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,820
like we used to allow people to
ride on it while it was

729
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,100
autonomous, and now we don't,
because it's not a safety thing.

730
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,860
But it was fun, you can ride on
it while the matter was going to

731
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,620
be pretty cool. But now if
somebody is on there, it won't

732
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,740
allow that. Right? So you know,
we've had our customers try and

733
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,140
put their safety people on it.
And there's videos of them, like

734
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,780
running up to it, jumping on it,
and just stopping immediately.

735
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,810
We're like, don't do that. And
they're like, Well, you gotta

736
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,110
test it. I was like, okay,
funny.

737
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,400
Audrow Nash: So it almost to me,
it seems like a clever approach

738
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:53,640
to do this, where you have the
ability to toggle between the

739
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,610
two, because it seems like if
you're making a fully autonomous

740
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,490
mower, and you're building the
entire mower for the fully

741
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,040
autonomous case, so you're not
making a spot for the human to

742
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,880
sit and work on it, for the
drive it, it makes it so you

743
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,580
have to solve every hard
problem. And I think that that's

744
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,690
probably like, there's a lot of
them, I'm sure you can speak to

745
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,750
like, how do you know if I don't
know, you can go over these

746
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,650
routes or go around all the
things. But then having the

747
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,750
human do these hard ones, that
seems very

748
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,240
Charles Brian Quinn: clever too
good example would be like high

749
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,090
grass, right? You know, so like,
there's a big, you know, brush

750
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,220
of grass. And we ran into this,
right? Like, you know, one of

751
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,380
our customers got a little
behind, because they don't have

752
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,380
enough labor. And they came out,
they're like, Hey, listen, like

753
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,350
this field is like knee high
grass, like I was supposed to

754
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:45,270
hit it last three weeks before,
and I didn't, it's like way up

755
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,660
here. And we're like, instead of
the mower was like, like, can't

756
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,960
go here can't go here. Like,
even we have a feature for

757
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,360
avoidance, which you know, and
feel they can just have it go

758
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,280
around. And so it's just
constantly trying to go around

759
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,010
everything. And he's like, it
looks like it's drunk. And we

760
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,250
look at the cameras. And so we
look through the RGB. And we're

761
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:07,440
like, whoa. And so we did design
a feature for relaxed obstacle

762
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,310
detection. And so we raised the
ground plane of the ransack. And

763
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,030
so we do let him operate with a
higher, but but when we do that,

764
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,340
again, this is all about jobs to
be done. So we trust our

765
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,370
operators, they're trained,
they're certified to do it. And

766
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,650
we, you know, train them on
this. And we said, hey, listen,

767
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,200
when you press this button,
it'll relax it, you know, you

768
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,750
better be sure that there's
nothing in there. And when he

769
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,850
did, he was like, works great.
And we rolled that out, you

770
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,310
know, two weeks later, and he
was like, This is wonderful.

771
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,400
Thank you. Can you can you add
this feature? And we're like,

772
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,340
Yep, sure can. So we keep going
with them. And that's kind of

773
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,760
how we run. Which you're right.
It's, it's, it's the iterative

774
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,700
approach, right? And you You hit
the nail on the head, which is,

775
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,080
how do we augment human
capabilities, you know,

776
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,100
especially were in these highly
repetitive, dangerous, dull,

777
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,820
dirty, monotonous things that
robots are very good at and

778
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,380
likened to, and then how do we
keep the person able to do the

779
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,400
creative, you know, unique,
beautiful, and things that

780
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,030
humans will always be good at
and should be good. And, you

781
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,090
know, that to me is the future.
It's, it's what I love, like,

782
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,950
why I do this, and why I get up
every day.

783
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,250
Audrow Nash: It's also the So
for all those are great reasons.

784
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,000
It's also pragmatic as a startup
to, because you're not doing the

785
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,210
hardest problem. First, you're
not doing every hard problem all

786
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,950
at once. Yeah, you're doing just
the minimum to provide value in

787
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:33,450
a market, which is fantastic for
I mean, like, I mean, I'm

788
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:38,340
thinking about autonomous cars
now. And you see huge companies

789
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,660
like, say, like Cruz, who has
like, I don't know exactly, but

790
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,320
like 1000s of engineers working
on this problem, to fully

791
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,550
automate driving. And a lot of
really great things have come

792
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,490
out of that. But as a startup,
it's hard to do because you

793
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:59,610
don't have 2000 engineers. So
solving an easier problem that

794
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,490
still provides a lot of value,
kind of like what Tesla's doing,

795
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,330
in a sense.

796
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,640
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah. And
again, we're just we're sort of

797
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,910
copying a lot of this crazy has
been amazing. Our product

798
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,160
manager that was just in San
Francisco and holidays and was

799
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,140
like a solid couple around
around he's like, it's

800
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,350
incredibly out there everywhere.
It's crazy. And you that way Mo

801
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,380
Yeah, yep. So it's the only
choice here it's just not evenly

802
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,500
distributed. And what I tend to
think about the off road

803
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,290
capabilities, what we're doing
in the autonomous space where

804
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,230
you know, it's interesting for
us is I always tell people is

805
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:33,090
like, hey, when we don't know
what to do, we stop. Now, I

806
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,640
think as a self driving car, I
think when you don't know what

807
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,720
to do, like, you can't just stop
in the freeway, right? Yeah. Oh,

808
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,470
gosh. There has to be a lot more
and there's people involved and

809
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,770
plenty for us who are in
controlled environments like we

810
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,770
can in some of the center's
we're working with are sort of

811
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,710
industrial Right. So there's a
controlled environment, you

812
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,590
know, you don't have people
running around. Hell, it's it's

813
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,750
interesting, because people were
like, Well, what about schools

814
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,660
and kids and it's like, hey, why
don't you ask us landscaper,

815
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,080
what they do? And have you ever
seen a landscaper milling around

816
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,230
kids know if the kids are out,
they don't know, period and the

817
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,310
story like manually. So, you
know, so So the automation is

818
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,550
capable of doing now and I think
that the offered space will

819
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:17,250
continue to have leaps and
bounds. I?

820
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,930
Audrow Nash: What do you mean
off road space?

821
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,730
Charles Brian Quinn: So when you
think there's when I think about

822
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,190
autonomy, there's a lot of
standards right now, if you look

823
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,400
at some of the bodies that are
certifying on road autonomy

824
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:32,190
through some of the standards,
like the ISO 2626262. Yeah. Or

825
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,950
what I think it is, it's one of
those I just to say, just say

826
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,780
this is until it repeats, but
you have the

827
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,380
Audrow Nash: right Ryan therapy
from clear path you mentioned

828
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,130
next Tuesday, or something like
this, often, okay.

829
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,840
Charles Brian Quinn: And so
those are the those are the

830
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,110
autonomy levels, right? Level
one up to level five were like,

831
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,630
level five is just, you know,
and level five, kind of

832
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,230
interesting, because I've heard
people say that level five would

833
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,750
be like, You tell your car,
like, hey, take me to the beach,

834
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,030
and it takes you to work
instead. Because it's like, Hey,

835
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,570
you actually need to go to work.
Like it's truly self directed,

836
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:08,220
right? It's like, No, you don't
need to compete. But um, the,

837
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,070
the i digress a little bit, but
we talked about on river

838
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,580
software, there's the standards
and in off road, we don't have

839
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,320
that, like there isn't a body
learning is exactly that that's,

840
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,020
that's determining these, we do
have is a lot of some of the

841
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,250
ones for industrial robotics.
And so their standards like ar

842
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,570
1508, which is a robotics for
automated machinery, and

843
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,910
vehicles. And those are the ones
that we're going for those

844
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,030
standards. And we've been really
lucky, we've working with some

845
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,600
external consultants for risk
analysis, as well as we've got

846
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,620
just hired some validation
engineer from from Rivia. And so

847
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,660
we have a lot of firepower on
that. And I think that are, and

848
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,030
we're working with some of the
industry as well, some of the

849
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,660
outer power industry people
directly to help make sure that

850
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,880
those are safe standards, but
we're doing that in conjunction

851
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,060
with our customer, who also like
has a job that they want to get

852
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,600
done. You know, I tell my team,
we have six core values and

853
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,500
safety first is first. And
number six is customer success.

854
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,560
And they're not in real order.
You know, they're all important.

855
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,320
But if you think about it, like
if safety is like the most

856
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,320
critical, then the safest thing
to do would be to just sit in a

857
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,980
insulated bubble and tell our
customers you can No, because

858
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,790
mowings dangerous, right? That'd
be the safest it is. But in the

859
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,930
end, there's customer success,
and they've got a job to do. And

860
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,440
while it is dangerous, we accept
those risks. And we the reason

861
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,960
we accept this risk is because
we've done enough risk analysis

862
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,440
to know that like, hey, if I do
this safely, and I follow the

863
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,440
procedures and the guidelines,
the risk is low enough, that I'm

864
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,490
safe to do this. And so where we
fit is trying to bridge that gap

865
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,670
between I've got this job to be
done. And I still want to do it

866
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,810
safely and with the least amount
of risk possible. And I frankly

867
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,990
think that when we look back in
the in the future, we're gonna

868
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,470
look back and say, Wow, can you
believe that we had humans

869
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,620
sitting standing riding on these
things that were prone to

870
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:06,450
rollovers and a huge spinning
blade? Yeah. And we'll be like,

871
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,000
oh, yeah, we used to used to
drive around in cars and smash

872
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,570
into each other. Oh,

873
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,570
Audrow Nash: no, I'm just gonna
say, yeah, yeah, the cars are so

874
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:17,550
dangerous, but, and it's funny,
because, like, they're still

875
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:20,640
relatively safe, but they are
one of the most dangerous,

876
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,270
dangerous things in modern
society. So I think, like 50

877
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,270
years from now, it'll be like,
our parents that we were driving

878
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,610
around, like the risk, but

879
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,120
Charles Brian Quinn: it's the
only way to go right now. So

880
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,450
Audrow Nash: it's true. Yeah,
unless you walk or bicycle and

881
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,790
bicycling is much more
dangerous. And city it is.

882
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,380
Charles Brian Quinn: Speaking of
bicycling, you got to get,

883
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:49,740
you've got to get Brandon from
Luxan us on your podcast, the

884
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,820
homework that he's been doing
with depth a AI and the depth AI

885
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:58,950
platform. These are our cameras
that basically run AI ml on

886
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,510
them. And they have great Ross
drivers. And we're helping a

887
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:07,740
little bit with that open
sourcing a lot, but phenomenal

888
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,770
and vegan advice. And he started
this company because he had some

889
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,400
friends who and I won't mess
with his story. But they had a

890
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,150
some accidents. And he was like,
how do we prevent this? And he's

891
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,780
like, we got to get a camera
that faces behind. And so he

892
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,270
tried to prototype one and was
like, you know, how do we do

893
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,060
this and, and with AI and ML
where it is right now he was

894
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,090
able to do it. And so he open
sourced the platform so that

895
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,950
other people are able to do it.
And we're actually excited to

896
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,740
start implementing that on our
next gen, which we've already

897
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,600
started. And so in terms of, you
know, think about like the real

898
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,070
sense and the depth. Cloud is a
great protocol for algorithmic

899
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,100
but like I said that AI stuff is
coming fast. I mean, the stuff

900
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,280
that they can even do, they can
even output a Deaf cloud using

901
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,410
you know, something. Exactly,
exactly. And the quality better

902
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,830
than stereo and these kinds of
things and I've been super

903
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,220
impressed and they fast. So
we're definitely got to get him

904
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,560
on. Because he's, I mean, in
terms of robots, they're gonna

905
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,820
revolutionize it, I think.

906
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,940
Audrow Nash: Awesome. I'll look
into having him on the podcast.

907
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,230
Thank you for the
recommendation. One, one thing

908
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:20,370
that I'm wondering, like, where
do you see standards bodies

909
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,600
being helpful in these? Is it
because they establish well

910
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,280
defined protocols that are well
thought out? And thus they

911
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,540
reduce risk? Or where's the
value in establishing these

912
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,820
standards? Yeah, I probably

913
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,790
Charles Brian Quinn: not the
best person to ask this as an

914
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,180
entrepreneur who thinks that all
rules are there for somebody

915
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:49,470
else. I'm kidding. The rules are
meant to be broken. I don't

916
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:53,280
believe that, but I'll say this,
I mean, I benefit from them

917
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,910
every single day. You know,
like, from, from the headphone

918
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,600
jack, I just plugged into to the
USB that I had to plug in, and

919
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,990
then turn around and then put
back and then do it that way.

920
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:09,330
Right. Those are all standards,
right? Web Standards. You know,

921
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:14,460
Ross being a standard, the rep,
like we talked about, I'm a huge

922
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,430
fan of those. And so what I
think where, where I think the

923
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:24,060
best things get built, is in a
company is leading, and really

924
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,960
driving that. And then it isn't
all driven by consensus and

925
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,680
committee. Now, I'm a big fan of
committees, we're on a few. And

926
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,830
but where I think that you can
get in trouble is trying to

927
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,700
design by consensus, I have a
rule in our company, and my team

928
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,820
will will kill me for saying
this. But there's three types of

929
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,640
decisions that are made at Green
sea. And this is all companies

930
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,600
by the way. There's command
control. There's consensus. And

931
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,390
then with there's consultative,
right, so let's go through the

932
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,300
three. So in command is when I
come come in the room, and I'm

933
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,780
like, Hey, guys, or hey, people,
Hey, everybody, Hey, person's

934
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,980
everybody. We're doing this. And
everybody goes, Okay, let's do

935
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,630
it. consultative is, His command
is pretty good. And sort of

936
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,700
wartime and scenarios when you
need somebody just come and say,

937
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,980
Hey, this is what we're doing.
We make decisions. Yeah.

938
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,910
consultative is very good. And
consultative is very critical,

939
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,160
and probably the one you should
be doing in business. And the

940
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,100
most important, that's the one
where, where someone comes in

941
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,860
and says, Hey, there's a
decision that I'm in charge of

942
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,950
making, because I'm responsible
for this, you seek expertise,

943
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,680
correct. And you said, I'm
seeking your consultation on it.

944
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,860
But ultimately, I have the call.
And that's how all decisions in

945
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,580
business should be made. The
only decision in business that

946
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:44,460
should be done consensus is
where do we go for lunch? Yeah,

947
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,510
because I just think that the
that watering down of sort of,

948
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,750
like, you know, we've got to get
all everybody to buy in and

949
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,080
fully understand it. You know,
if you had to ask everybody,

950
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,530
just nothing would get done. And
so I do appreciate committees

951
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:03,570
that are the appropriate size,
that are in that actually have

952
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:08,160
stakeholders who are committed
and not just in it to sort of

953
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,850
Express power or sort of
lobbying or interest that aren't

954
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,360
their own, then I think you have
very good standards, and I'm all

955
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,600
for that, you know, so again,
you get real world, you know,

956
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,390
and that's what I like about the
ones we're on there. They're not

957
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,570
from, you know, people who are
just trying to stamp this out or

958
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,950
competitive. They are people who
are actually like, nd user, you

959
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,470
know, who benefit from it. And
where I think there's benefits

960
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:35,610
is that, you know, we've seen
this in the automotive industry,

961
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,920
you know, there are standards
bodies that say, like, Hey,

962
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,690
here's what we think true sort
of autonomy would look like. And

963
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,540
these are some of the things we
do you know, it's funny, there's

964
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,060
a simple one that you know, I
got a new car. And when you go

965
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,390
to the back, there's a liftgate
and there's a button, and all

966
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:55,080
the iconic, iconic RV, is all
sort of standardized, right? And

967
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,740
so, you know, it seems funny,
like it's an SUV, but the the

968
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,420
Connor icon or Greg, I forget
it, the icon itself is that

969
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,660
looks like a card or something,
right. And it's a hood closing,

970
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,480
but it's I know, when I see that
button, I click that, and I know

971
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,110
that the hood will close. And
that's because of standards help

972
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,900
us all. So we all don't have to
read the manual every time we do

973
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,280
something. They really help with
usability safety, and I'm a big

974
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,270
fan. I do do sense, though, that
there are some that are probably

975
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,750
gotten too big or don't have
appropriate stakeholders that

976
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,570
matter anymore where I think a
lot of damage can be done.

977
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,780
Audrow Nash: How do you
determine if it's too big? Oh,

978
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,820
or how do you figure out the one
size?

979
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,670
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah, I'm
not the one to determine it. I

980
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,430
think it's all context
dependent, but I'll quote Yeah,

981
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,190
he says, because he seems to be
the smartest man on the planet.

982
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,790
He says, What is it the pizza
rule? Right? So if you can feed

983
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,420
a pizza, that group is fine.
It's the fine size but anything

984
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,230
bigger than that? He's like, get
rid of it. So everything is done

985
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,140
in feeding. I think it's I think
it's the pizza rule and maybe

986
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,940
two pizzas. I'll have to look it
up.

987
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,960
Audrow Nash: Something some
small number of pizzas. Anyways.

988
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,550
Interesting. Okay, going back to
your autonomous system a bit

989
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:14,160
more. So you have many depth
cameras, they're pointed. So you

990
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,140
use odometry, odometry. And GPS.
You're doing some sensor fusion

991
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,580
there and is fusion. Correct. So
we local and global, right? Yep,

992
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:28,140
go ahead. And then you have
cameras, depth cameras. So you

993
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,920
were mentioning the Intel real
sense, which is structured

994
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,010
lighting, I believe, or maybe it
sends out a laser or something

995
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,100
Charles Brian Quinn: it does in
the outdoor, it probably ignores

996
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,220
a lot of the pattern project
that happens the IR projection

997
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,100
because of just using stereo, or
what doesn't it works pretty

998
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,790
well said is is stereo depth,
right? Yeah. And no, in between

999
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,170
them. Yep. And so

1000
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,300
Audrow Nash: you can infer how
far away everything is by the

1001
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,480
disparity in the images taken by
both of the cameras and go,

1002
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,990
Okay, so you have those, those
are facing all you have, like,

1003
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,500
one of them on each corner, or
they're all around

1004
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,790
Charles Brian Quinn: the 360.
But what's interesting is that

1005
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,390
there are directions that a
mower cannot go just like a car,

1006
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,690
right? You know, you can't see a
car can't suddenly move

1007
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:17,580
laterally diagonal back. Yeah.
Perfect. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1008
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,470
Yeah, exactly. Not morphic. And
so having said that, we have

1009
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,570
pretty close to 360. But we
actually have a bias towards the

1010
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,700
front being more important,
because that's the primary

1011
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,150
direction that it goes. And so
that that sensor is actually a

1012
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,640
little bit duplicated. If you
look at our current one, we have

1013
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,040
a little bit of overlap. And
those are calibrated, like I

1014
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,310
said, to make sure that we can
see. But yeah, so we have very

1015
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,890
good coverage around the mower,
and then in the back. But

1016
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,740
there's I mean, there are
definitely sort of areas, you

1017
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,900
know, sort of here where it does
not move, but the

1018
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:53,520
Audrow Nash: left and back right
kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Okay,

1019
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,770
cuz you're not as worried about
someone approaching in the

1020
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,390
mower, run running them over

1021
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:01,500
Charles Brian Quinn: for an even
go that way. Exactly. And even

1022
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,900
the turns that it does, as soon
as it turns it sees you and he's

1023
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,290
like, Well, I can't finish that
turn, right. I see.

1024
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,470
Audrow Nash: And yeah, these are
you said, it's like two wheel

1025
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,050
drive two, and you can turn in
place because the front wheels

1026
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:13,860
or casters.

1027
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,600
Charles Brian Quinn: That's
right, he's got all that zero

1028
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,500
turn or turn on a dime. Right.
And so what's interesting is

1029
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,220
when I first we first got the
the mower, you know, we're I

1030
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,710
used to be able to say I was new
to landscaping. Now I can't

1031
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:29,520
write having been in a while.
And so when we would do, we

1032
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,710
would go out and we'd be like,
Oh, cool. Let's just turn and we

1033
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,750
would just zero turn right
there. And when you do it,

1034
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,420
landscapers will go like, Oh,
you just rotted the grass,

1035
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,140
because it's true. Can you
imagine? If you have one wheel

1036
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,440
that stays stationary, and you
pivot the other you especially

1037
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,950
good? Yeah, you actually tear up
the grass. And so our first

1038
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:50,400
turns were terrible. You don't
say don't put one wheel forward

1039
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,920
one wheel in reverse. You do
now. And that's what our

1040
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,280
algorithm does, right? So that's
what we do is we call it a

1041
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,490
perfect, they call it the Y turn
or the you know, and so you can

1042
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,040
watch our machine do it, but it
goes forward. And then it

1043
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:07,350
actually uses its own an
inertial I guess. I don't know

1044
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,960
what you call it, but it's sort
of kinematically so that it

1045
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,290
backs up, and then goes
straight, and it lines up those

1046
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,380
casters perfect. And so it
executes what is a very good

1047
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,200
turn. And when when landscapers
see it, they're like, Whoa, it

1048
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,710
looks like an excuse. That's
right. And it doesn't run the

1049
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,200
grass. And of course it does it
every time, which is kind of

1050
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,060
fun. I mean, if you're in a
hurry, you can always just you

1051
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,340
know, get out of there. Yeah.
Well, what's great about a

1052
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,000
robot, right, is that a robot is
one time to do it. And it's

1053
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,520
like, I'm happy to do that exact
same turn every single time.

1054
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,270
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Okay. So do
you have any other sensors?

1055
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,650
Charles Brian Quinn: On your
outside? Let's see. So I think

1056
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,780
we are. Yeah, so we we've had
ultrasonic video on it. Ultra

1057
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,320
problem with ultrasonics is and
that was shortly that some of

1058
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,810
our machines still have it, but
we're not using those. And I'm

1059
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,590
happy to disclose why that at
the speeds inside times we were

1060
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,370
going it was only turning on for
a very minimal amount of the

1061
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:06,180
thing because, you know, we're
going I would say pretty fast.

1062
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:12,450
And we have been insanely happy
with the point clouds. And we've

1063
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:16,440
actually our newest generation
has a lidar that has added a

1064
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,950
secondary form of redundancy.
We're actually using the ouster,

1065
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,090
and we're super happy with that.
And we actually on our current

1066
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:27,600
gen, we use the live ox LIDAR as
well. And with that, and the

1067
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,690
depth sensing cameras, we've got
our redundancy and it's much

1068
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:35,910
better than the the ultrasonics
were really fun. Yeah, they're

1069
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:38,880
very noisy and at the speed and
vibration we were doing they

1070
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,400
just weren't adding a lot of
value. There was no they were

1071
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,220
not making the system safer,
which was the whole point. They

1072
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,330
were adding complexity to the
BOM cost bill of material and so

1073
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:52,200
we just we decided to cancel
them I would be I'm impressed

1074
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,880
with some of the new stuff
that's coming out. We're always

1075
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,610
evaluating sensors in our lab
downstairs. We have some fun

1076
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:59,790
stuff that I probably can't talk
about, but there is some unique

1077
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,030
stuff out there that are in the
ultrasonic and sort of i What

1078
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,900
would you would call closer to
that almost audio type spectrum

1079
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,710
than visible light, right, that
I think will be capable. But the

1080
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,440
neat thing about what we're
doing is, again, if it's a

1081
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,820
structured data and we can use
it, then we will incorporate it

1082
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,580
as part of our standard and
spec. But as of right now, those

1083
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,530
ultrasonics are tremendous. A
lot of it. Yeah.

1084
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,740
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And so for
LiDAR, are you using? Is it a

1085
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,500
planar lighter? Or is it one
that's sending out a few strips,

1086
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:28,980
or

1087
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,970
Charles Brian Quinn: the live
box is a unique? One that I

1088
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:36,330
think is I am probably not the
best to talk about, we have a

1089
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,580
whole systems team that
evaluates a hardware, and I saw

1090
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,920
a couple of them come in, and I
definitely saw the pricing of

1091
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,580
some of them coming in. We have
stuff in our lab. You know, I

1092
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,760
think we, so we're venture
backed. And so what's

1093
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,790
interesting to me is, and I've
never I've been always done

1094
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,060
bootstrap companies. But in
venture, we're trading a capital

1095
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,780
for speed and growth and, and
have making our customers happy.

1096
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,410
And so what our team does now is
and it's real fun to be on the

1097
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:05,010
green team, because they don't
come to me. They don't come to

1098
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,860
me period anymore. But they
don't come to me and say, you

1099
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:15,270
know, hey, there's a $35 IMU and
$1,000 IMU, which you know, they

1100
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:18,360
buy, they buy two of each one,
and we evaluate it, we choose

1101
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,320
the best one, right and, and we
FedEx Ship it like overnight if

1102
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,380
we can, right because time is of
the essence. So yeah, they do

1103
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,110
that now. And we know that. So I
think the one i The ones I've

1104
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,190
seen are the ouster OSC, Ro 128,
which is the highest grade one.

1105
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,860
And the reason is because, you
know, we all were software

1106
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,800
heads, too. So we're like, let's
buy the 128. Because if we, if

1107
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,460
we can software, make it in
software to a 64. Or the lower

1108
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,400
Rez like we can do that in
software? And we can figure out

1109
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,360
if, you know, yeah, right. So we
can always you can always go

1110
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,440
down lines in data and destroy
data, but you can't recreate it.

1111
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,580
So I've seen some of the you and
I've seen some of the initial

1112
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,220
work on that. And it's been
phenomenal, like the amount of

1113
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,430
you know it with our depth
cloud, you can tell what things

1114
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,830
are like you can see humans and
you know, because it's hard to

1115
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:08,130
visualize, right? Like as humans
were not good at visualizing a

1116
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,620
depth cloud, even though there
are some things to do it with

1117
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,560
color and things like that, like
red is close. And blue is far

1118
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,640
whatever it may be. But with the
the LiDAR, like the amount of

1119
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,940
data in line scanning that we
get with both of those units has

1120
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,700
been phenomenal. In terms of
range.

1121
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,370
Audrow Nash: Interesting. Do you
think the LIDAR will ever

1122
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,050
replace the depth cameras?

1123
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,800
Charles Brian Quinn: I, I'm of
course,

1124
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,200
Audrow Nash: redundant system.
Yeah, yeah, I'm

1125
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,240
Charles Brian Quinn: a prevalent
probabilistic guy, right? You

1126
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,270
you, you nail that ahead of
time. And so I think that the

1127
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,600
world is full of dirty sensor
data. And you should take as

1128
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,070
much of that dirty sensory data
as you can apply probability to

1129
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,580
do the task at hand. And
whatever comes out needs to be

1130
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,440
the one I don't think that there
is an end all be all. Yeah, it's

1131
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,050
funny. I mean, you look at like
the Tesla. And I know that

1132
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:01,770
they're all super deep on
vision. But yeah, we know I have

1133
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,480
some friends in the industry
have been doing this well, and

1134
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:09,060
they're like, hey, like, fog.
You know, like, they're like

1135
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:13,890
fog. And they're like, so this
is like a known thing. So I

1136
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:19,650
would not be surprised if, if,
if the future is better than

1137
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,760
than humans. And it should be.
It could be. Oh, yeah, totally

1138
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,060
using sensors and things that we
don't have. We just, we happen

1139
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,180
to see in RGB. So we send that
tend to sort of go for that. But

1140
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,870
there's no reason why the world
of a robot shouldn't have be

1141
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:36,360
like an insect that can totally
see, you know, completely

1142
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,390
different spectrum than us.
Right. Yeah. Infrared seems very

1143
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,360
useful for a lot of things. Like
all sorts of other things.

1144
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:51,180
Audrow Nash: Okay. That's really
cool. The let's see. So, these

1145
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,390
are your sensors. And then do
you have a you have a computer

1146
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,490
onboard? You mentioned it's an
x86 architecture. What is it? Is

1147
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:02,040
it like a super powerful
computer is the now

1148
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,100
Charles Brian Quinn: here's,
there are a couple other things.

1149
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,580
I mentioned that so the computer
is not very powerful, but I

1150
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,850
would say it probably is. The
main thing though, is heat. So

1151
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:17,310
they're ruggedized industrial
din, rated for fanless for heat

1152
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:20,220
and vibration, and those are
critical. And by the way, we

1153
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:26,070
have hit the limit on those in
Texas several times. It do not

1154
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,040
mess around in Texas. They do
not mess around with mowing.

1155
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,200
They have practice fields on
practice fields.

1156
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,290
Audrow Nash: Wow. That's crazy.
That field for mowing,

1157
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,300
Charles Brian Quinn: you think
it's practice fields for

1158
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,530
football, but and, and all this,
but it has just for mowing?

1159
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:44,940
Yeah. Well, we have those. We
have those but Yes, but But

1160
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,630
yeah, and so we'd be out there
and it was 105 Fahrenheit, which

1161
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,690
is I don't know what that is in
Celsius. I should because I'm 30

1162
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:56,370
pharmacists close to. Yeah. And
so our computers are rated for I

1163
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:00,270
think they may be up to 70 or
something like that. which is

1164
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:05,490
nuts 7070 Celsius, which is like
140. So I may be off and maybe

1165
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,820
40 and 140 because I'm not very
good at the conversions. Because

1166
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:12,750
I have Siri that just tells me.
But anyway, the point of the

1167
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:18,240
story is that we hit the limit.
And our USB bus died and fell

1168
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,610
off. And so all the cameras were
gone. And of course, the mowing

1169
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,130
is like, stop. But what's funny
is we were like, We were

1170
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,250
apologizing their customer
customers, like I'm done to me.

1171
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,830
They're like in terms of human
like, we shouldn't be out here

1172
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:35,160
either. Like at when it's 105
humid, and our you know, yeah.

1173
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,770
So they're like, it's, you know,
you're good. You're good. buy

1174
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,220
our books. So but what is cool
is we did fix some of that, you

1175
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,920
know, when it made it more
robust? Yeah, we've had heat

1176
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,860
shielding. And some of the, you
know, exhausts i We got one of

1177
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,660
those flot FLIR Thermal guns to
flir measurements. Yeah. And I

1178
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,770
was surprised how hot do you
think it does get on the at the

1179
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:58,860
exhaust point of the engine on a
mower in Texas? Like, what's

1180
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:07,440
your guess? I don't know.
180 730 coming off, the exhaust

1181
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:12,210
says, That's pretty well, I
guess. Seven? Yeah, it's very

1182
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,150
hot. And so we originally had
our sort of exhaust sort of

1183
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,060
blowing towards the back of the
computer, and there's this area.

1184
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,180
And so ours would just heat up
to where it stopped. So now we

1185
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,490
vented it differently. We've
added some extra shielding with

1186
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,070
air, which is another reason why
we work we love working with the

1187
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,930
manufacturers, because they're
like, we've been dealing with

1188
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:31,860
heat shielding forever. They're
like, yeah, what you do. And

1189
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,750
they just added three things.
And they're like, done, and

1190
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,090
we're like, oh, cool. Check,
check.

1191
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,140
Audrow Nash: That was easy.
Yeah.

1192
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,180
Charles Brian Quinn: I don't
think we're done yet. But

1193
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:43,620
there's that now we do. Also, we
love microcontrollers. So we're

1194
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:48,210
a big fan of, I think we use
Arduinos, we use Teensies. I

1195
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,840
think TNCs are the current
generation. And the more we can

1196
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,150
do our we have another theory
about probabilistic robotics.

1197
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,820
But another theory is that the
more we can do at the low level

1198
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:01,110
hardware, the safer the system
will be. And so anything we can

1199
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:04,800
do that that becomes sort of
rote and is not in C++ or

1200
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,860
something high, like at a high
level, I would call C++ a high

1201
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,100
level language, even though you
can go low, you know, we can

1202
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,260
move that down to the
microcontroller and have a

1203
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:16,380
bonafide you know, thing that
when it turns on, that's the

1204
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:19,290
only thing it does. And it's
dedicated to the really single

1205
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,140
purpose. So it's the same reason
you like nodes. In a sense,

1206
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:25,470
you're exactly right. Yep. Okay.
Well, I'm super excited about

1207
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,960
some of the Ross to you know,
stuff that you can run, you

1208
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,660
know, oh, yeah, a device where
it just outputs a topic. Yeah,

1209
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,240
embedded, whatever, right. Yeah,
that's gonna be really cool.

1210
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:40,590
Audrow Nash: Why? So, if you're
using C? Or do you do things

1211
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,680
where you're allocating all your
memory beforehand? Or?

1212
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,020
Charles Brian Quinn: Excuse me?
Yeah, whereas in C++,

1213
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,950
Audrow Nash: oh, you said your
C++, okay. Yeah, the I do avoid

1214
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,560
Charles Brian Quinn: microcontrollers,
or C, right? And make sure we're

1215
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,140
doing that in whatever the the
microcontroller languages

1216
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:59,190
Arduino, ESP, whatever those
are. But yeah, we're using C++

1217
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,860
for the main stack. We still
also use some Python for a lot

1218
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:06,840
of the lower level. Statistics
are very good. So Mo, our

1219
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,810
progress monitor and a lot of
that stuff that generates graphs

1220
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,810
and gifts and things like that.
Can't be Python for that, for

1221
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:16,920
sure. So yeah, again, they all
speak Ross topics on the back

1222
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,830
end. So we're all happy to
oblige, right?

1223
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:23,489
Audrow Nash: When when you put
things on microcontrollers, how

1224
01:08:23,489 --> 01:08:24,209
do you test them?

1225
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:28,320
Charles Brian Quinn: Good
question. A lot of that is kept,

1226
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,710
you know, sort of very low
level, but it does not have the

1227
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,530
same test suite that our Ross
does. Yeah,

1228
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:36,660
Audrow Nash: cuz you're writing
all these things you probably

1229
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:41,070
have like a spool for maybe you
can run, I don't do this, we

1230
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,440
Charles Brian Quinn: do. We have
a lab downstairs, I'd have to go

1231
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,290
grab our systems engineer who is
probably down there doing it

1232
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:50,040
now. But a lot of input, a lot
of output. I mean, a lot of

1233
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,790
graphing manual testing to prove
that it will work as I expect.

1234
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,780
And we're huge sponsors of David
Piccante. And his work at Platja

1235
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,240
glare, like, you know, I think
we were one of the there's

1236
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,240
wonderful, we use it every day.
So we sent him a little love

1237
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,630
notes all the time. And I
couldn't be happier with that. I

1238
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:09,270
mean, that's a majority of our
work is actually it's funny,

1239
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,480
like we sent we put out graphs
of like, okay, here's what the

1240
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:16,710
lower level microcontroller
encoder reads are, you know,

1241
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,740
here's what it looks like. Now,
we replay replay replay a big

1242
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,740
fan of replaying data. You know,
we in terms of testing, we do

1243
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,950
have a good test suite that I'm
very proud of for robotic stack,

1244
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:29,640
we use the Ross unit and Ross
testing, we throw sensor data

1245
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,400
at, you know, we have a
continuous build server using

1246
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,420
circle CI and so when when our
you know, we commit code, it all

1247
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,120
goes on a circle CI server, it
runs the Ross unit tests and

1248
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,870
make sure that the basic knowing
sort of workflow still works.

1249
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,290
And we go massive amounts of
sensor data, we we, you know,

1250
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,500
have recorded us going through a
field full of obstacles and make

1251
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,680
sure that it's like yep, yep,
yep, yep. Yep. And that nothing

1252
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,620
you do interferes with the
ability for the mower to stop,

1253
01:09:55,650 --> 01:10:00,000
right? Yeah, for sure. Ah, very
cool. But you're right testing.

1254
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,720
I would love to see Ross get
better at this, I think, I think

1255
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:09,060
the Ross community would flip
out if they saw what US former

1256
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:12,120
web developers, the kind of
tooling that we have. Oh, yeah,

1257
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,450
I was super excited that you had
the guys from foxglove, which

1258
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:18,570
were huge fans of and users of
podcasts, which I know, they

1259
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:22,350
just raised a big round. And I'm
super fans of them and the

1260
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:25,230
testing that they're going to
do. Because I think they're

1261
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:28,800
going to level up our industry a
lot, you know, with with real

1262
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,260
time and sort of, you know,
we're, we've got some unique

1263
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,000
stuff that we're doing and
working with them where, you

1264
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,940
know, an incident happens in the
field. And that may be that a

1265
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,390
sensor, you know, sort of
encoded drops, or you know, some

1266
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:43,050
other things, and we can tag
that. And we can say, alright,

1267
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,320
what happened, because that's
real world data. And by the way,

1268
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,270
we're there in the field. So you
know, they're generating a ton

1269
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,700
of data. And so we can't go grab
the entire bag file, which we

1270
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,260
used to be, we'd be like,
somebody run out there with a

1271
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,960
hard drive. And like, same
thing. Yeah. So we built a

1272
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,990
pretty cool system that can you
can tag it. And then there's a

1273
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:03,420
Our Sync type process that runs
in the background. Nice, nice as

1274
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,720
a Unix command that will lower
the priority. So that like, the

1275
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,290
rest of the stuff can also it's
very low priority. So right, and

1276
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:14,280
so then it'll squirt that data
over that 32nd window of that

1277
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,040
thing to a server, and then we
give it to foxglove. And we're,

1278
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,980
like, visualize that. Because
that what happened there, right.

1279
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:24,690
Like, why did the mower, see it
saw a corrugated fence and

1280
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,610
thought there was an obstacle
straight in front of it when it

1281
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,910
was, you know, I mean, 30 meters
out, right. So stuff like that,

1282
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:34,620
right? Yeah, it's been very fun.
I digress. But we could

1283
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,450
definitely get better on the
testing side. And if you're

1284
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,330
interested in that, and find
more resources that we'd love to

1285
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:39,630
know.

1286
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:43,050
Audrow Nash: Yeah, for sure.
We're getting a little better

1287
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,440
with Ross too. Yeah, for some of
the testing resources, but I

1288
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,300
agree, it's a big and especially
for like industrial, or, like

1289
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:56,910
for company level reliability.
Like, we could probably improve

1290
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:01,320
a lot as a community total in
this space, I think. Let's see.

1291
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,650
How do you update your systems?

1292
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,930
Charles Brian Quinn: Very
excited and happy to talk about

1293
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:10,890
that. We part of my Ross CON
talk was a little bit on that.

1294
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:15,690
Now. I love the current system
that I believe you guys use for

1295
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,660
packaging, because I am a big
fan of it. I think it's what

1296
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,310
it's cat can plus,

1297
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,760
Audrow Nash: we use cold con
cold on we're here with Ross

1298
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,380
one. So yeah, yeah,

1299
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,240
Charles Brian Quinn: well,
there's that. And then blue are

1300
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,670
the bloom, that's the one I was
gonna talk about Bloom is the

1301
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:33,840
sort of thing that will create
packages, right. Now Debian

1302
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,370
packages for distribution on
Linux. So we evaluated using

1303
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:42,000
bloom and tried it for a little
while. But what we found is that

1304
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:46,200
we were unable to do a lot of
the sort of, we couldn't find a

1305
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,930
way to do meta packages, which
we use a lot of where it'll be

1306
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:53,940
like, you know, packages, well,
and also to pulling in other

1307
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:57,000
stuff. So what we did was we
went and we also were targeting

1308
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,230
just Debian so I sorry, ubuntu
LTS. And so we don't need to

1309
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:04,890
create RPM, or other things, you
know, generically, and so we're

1310
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:08,070
other Linux distributions or
other operating systems, okay.

1311
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,250
So what we do is we create our
own Debbie ends, and we use

1312
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,490
Debbie and proper, right, so we
just straight up, generate them,

1313
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:19,020
the Debbie and from, you know,
using the Debbie and maintainers

1314
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,140
guide, and all the tools that
exist with change log and all

1315
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:27,270
that stuff. And so then we build
packages. And then we have a

1316
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:32,580
couple of private repos that we
mirror Ross upstream. So thank

1317
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,800
you, I mean, that's a new thing
that a lot of people do, right?

1318
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,490
And and then we mirror you know,
Ross security and Eros updates.

1319
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,610
And so we have our own package
server. And so when our mower

1320
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:45,000
boots up, it runs apt update,
essentially. And if you look at

1321
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,100
my talk, it actually runs a
couple things. It's actually

1322
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,390
dist upgrade, you know, which is
an automated with why right. And

1323
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:55,470
so basically all our packages
are installed. And then when we

1324
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:58,980
do that, the system is still
running the current one. And so

1325
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,650
then when it when you go to
reboot it, it'll actually run

1326
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,580
the new stuff. And so we use a
ton of super small postinstall.

1327
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,280
There's a lot of stuff, neat
tricks you can do in some of the

1328
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,670
like, when after you install
something, you can, you can redo

1329
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:14,610
your config and kind of fixed
files and change variables and

1330
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,490
stuff. And I haven't found a
little bit of that lacking in

1331
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:20,610
the sort of automated stuff. So
again, when we control the full

1332
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,970
Debian, we can do a lot of that.
And so we've been really excited

1333
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:28,230
by that I would love to, I've
heard that snaps are good. And

1334
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,380
I'd be really curious to explore
that. I've even tried to connect

1335
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,720
with some of the people that are
working on that. But I'm just

1336
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,540
again, I'm a low level sort of
Unix guy and I've been doing

1337
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:40,170
Debian and Ubuntu for so long
that when there was a tool out

1338
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:42,840
there like apt and Debbie and I
was like, just reach for it and

1339
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,860
say, Okay, let's do this. Yep.
But it's been fun. The other fun

1340
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,320
stuff is there's some neat stuff
we used to use a package called

1341
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,080
rep rep row to to manage them.
And then there's another one

1342
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,290
came along called athlete that
allows us to snapshot and mirror

1343
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,410
these and now we have what's
really cool is when you deploy

1344
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:03,150
code to our mowers The automated
system will run all the tests.

1345
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,810
It'll, it'll actually generate a
bunch of Debbi ins, it goes and

1346
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:10,530
installs them automatically on
our experimental mowers. So we

1347
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,560
have a couple of tests on the
platform. So on each mower,

1348
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,250
you're running the tests or your
CI, run the test on the CI,

1349
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,800
which is like a desk, for
instance, that mimics the whole

1350
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,170
install, right? And so, but
you're right, it doesn't have a

1351
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:25,440
lot of the sensors on it,
they're all fake right, then. So

1352
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,630
you're right. So there needs to
be somebody needs to test it.

1353
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:30,690
And so what we do is we have a
fleet, and I showed you ahead of

1354
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:34,260
time, before we were on our lab,
where we have a couple hours,

1355
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,840
some of these mowers are on what
we call the experimental branch

1356
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,940
and experimental is just the
Debian wording for hasn't yet

1357
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:44,940
been released to production. And
we use that term lightly, but

1358
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:48,180
they're experimental. And so
they run bleeding edge. And so

1359
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,970
what that means is that when
they turn on, they're running

1360
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,440
main, which was formerly known
as GitHub master, right. And so

1361
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:58,560
they run main. And so when you
commit code, you can go

1362
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,490
downstairs and you can run it on
experimental. And we do we we

1363
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:05,460
run around our lab, and you saw
the field where we met out back.

1364
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:08,160
And so we'll go and run that
around and make sure that the

1365
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,070
all the functionality is there.
And as soon as we do enough of

1366
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:14,880
that, we then do a release. And
release is nothing more than the

1367
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,620
git pull request that packages
up all everything from that's

1368
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,050
been an experimental for a while
we do those every one or two

1369
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:24,840
weeks. And what's nice about
that is we do release notes, and

1370
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,110
then we text message our
customers with those, you know,

1371
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:31,020
improvements and features a lot
of our developer, but a lot of

1372
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,180
them and then we work them both
in English and Spanish and make

1373
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,370
sure that they know that, hey,
the Moto is going to be updated

1374
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:38,340
next time you turn it on, you
know, I think eventually we'll

1375
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,550
have to just copy the Tesla
interface where you can download

1376
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:44,040
the update and then apply it.
And then you know, there's three

1377
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:48,450
options. But for now, we are
automating and forcing those

1378
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:51,360
upgrades, because everybody is
on the same one. And we can do

1379
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,240
that because we're able to
manage, but I'm sure we'll get

1380
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:57,180
more sophisticated, but we're
really happy with that. And I'd

1381
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,390
love to open source more in that
area. It's just when I go to do

1382
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,820
it. I'm like, Oh, this is
Debbie. And this is apt this is

1383
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,030
you know,

1384
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:06,750
Audrow Nash: it's just a process
very specific to specific to us.

1385
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,320
And also, it's

1386
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,810
Charles Brian Quinn: like, it's
just a way to use all these open

1387
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:11,670
source that's pretty well
documented. So

1388
01:17:12,209 --> 01:17:16,019
Audrow Nash: yeah, I feel like
like a really well written

1389
01:17:16,019 --> 01:17:18,629
tutorial or blog posts would be
awesome around that kind of

1390
01:17:18,629 --> 01:17:22,679
thing. Challenge accepted.
Because yeah,

1391
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,270
Charles Brian Quinn: I'll
definitely make keep doing that

1392
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,540
the Ross talks, because we
definitely enjoy that we were

1393
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,510
asked to I think this year, and
we're big fans and sponsors, I

1394
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:32,580
hope to sponsor that bigger
level NEXT TIME TO

1395
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:38,100
Audrow Nash: HELL YEAH. YEAH. So
can you talk a bit more about

1396
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,070
safety in your design? Or like
making it robust?

1397
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:43,230
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah,
absolutely. I think about this

1398
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,620
all the time. From, you know,
the current thing that we're

1399
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,310
doing, we've gotten a lot
better, and we're continuing to

1400
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:53,340
get better. You know, safety is
our first core value safety

1401
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,980
first. And so one of the things
we're doing right now that I'm

1402
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:01,650
very proud of is that we have a
PhD risk. A person who just

1403
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:05,340
absolutely loves thinking about
risk data and is asked just I

1404
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,860
mean, the amount of data and
things he asked for, you know,

1405
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:12,300
he's like, how many accidents
happened in this way that led to

1406
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,270
hospitalization through this and
he's like, Okay, we put this in

1407
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:19,470
our system. And he's got things
that he's automated to basically

1408
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:22,890
help us make sure that we adhere
to the highest level to some of

1409
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:25,950
these standards that are out
there. And so our current system

1410
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,750
is pretty well documented in how
we adhere to these based on our

1411
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,030
understanding interpretation.
And as we get better

1412
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:35,550
understanding, and as we get
better sensor data and things,

1413
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,210
it can be updated, and do
iteration. Exactly. And a lot of

1414
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:42,240
the work we do is in validating
those. So the key areas that I

1415
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,150
would think that that your
audience might be interested on

1416
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:49,110
are, we are constantly trying to
push the limits of the obstacle

1417
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:52,950
detection framework and
pipeline, so our customers, what

1418
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:54,960
we tell them, and what it
actually does is a little

1419
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,900
different, right? So we err on
the side of safety. So our

1420
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,650
system can detect obstacles of a
certain size. And I won't go

1421
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:05,400
into that right now. But and
what we tell them is it has to

1422
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,470
be of this size, and we do that
for that margin.

1423
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,670
Audrow Nash: So you give them
the worst case and you

1424
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:13,650
internally, it's something a
little better on that,

1425
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:15,810
Charles Brian Quinn: right. And
then what they know is they say,

1426
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:18,150
okay, cool, right. And so the
biggest one is people are like,

1427
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:20,670
Hey, does it detect sprinkler
heads? And I'm like, Absolutely

1428
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:23,430
not. You know, like, those are
too small. And I was like, you

1429
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,860
know, sometimes as humans even
have trouble, like, you know,

1430
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,450
Audrow Nash: right over.

1431
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,220
Charles Brian Quinn: And what
the neat part is, though, is

1432
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:31,680
that when I asked them really
like, what what are you getting

1433
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,410
at? Like, what? And they say,
Well, you know, if this thing's

1434
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:36,120
going to do the whole thing, it
needs to know that like

1435
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,820
remember, you do the boundary
and I was like, why don't you

1436
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:43,050
just like do that part yourself?
And you go around where you

1437
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,940
know, those are because you
install them? He's like, Oh,

1438
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,970
yeah, I installed all this
finger heads. Right? And then

1439
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:50,220
I'm not gonna hit him, right and
so and I was like, why don't you

1440
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:54,210
just go one lap inside, do a lap
and let the mower do that and

1441
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:57,060
then you take out a string
trimmer edger wieder blower and

1442
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:57,900
you do that detailed

1443
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,420
Audrow Nash: work while you do
it. Oh, that's awesome. They can

1444
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,650
parallelize their own

1445
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,540
Charles Brian Quinn: effort.
Yeah. And so that's pipelining

1446
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,300
is huge. In fact, you know, when
I talk about, you know, greens,

1447
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,140
the we take job openings, not
jobs, right? There's, there's

1448
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:13,740
hundreds, and there's 1000s of
job openings, just that one of

1449
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:17,490
our customers, you know, for,
you know, workers that they

1450
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,880
don't have and can't find. And
so when green Z comes along, it

1451
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,150
says, I'll take that really
boring one. And you can, you can

1452
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,910
pipeline. So that crew that used
to be a three or five person

1453
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:30,300
crew can be like one or two
people now with a couple of

1454
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,150
robotic workers, and now they're
doing the same work that they

1455
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:36,420
were able to do. And they're
able to go home, you know,

1456
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,450
sooner and go talk to the kids
and just, you know,

1457
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,150
Audrow Nash: do all that. Yeah,
exactly. It's, I mean, it's less

1458
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:44,490
work for everyone to do,
basically, because the robot is

1459
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:49,170
taking over some of it. Yep. At
least taking some of it that was

1460
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,120
already there. And, like, not
there aren't enough people for

1461
01:20:54,180 --> 01:21:00,990
thinking and sound. Yeah. Okay.
So with how do you how do you

1462
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,140
test your robots? So you
mentioned that you go, you have

1463
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:10,380
this main branch, and you'll go
and you test it on your robot in

1464
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,230
your fields? How do you make
sure that something is ready to

1465
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:17,520
be deployed to all of the mowers
on in your system?

1466
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,960
Charles Brian Quinn: I'm glad
you asked this, because this

1467
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,150
circles back to something I
said, let's talk about in the

1468
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:24,300
future, and that is that we eat
our own dog food. And what I

1469
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:30,240
mean by that is that we are
current subcontractors to a

1470
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:35,130
couple of our customers so we
are mowers I'm, I'm wearing the

1471
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:38,100
outfit. I actually have a
uniform, I wear this I have five

1472
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:42,450
of these shirts, and I'm wearing
the lawn mowing shoes. And, and

1473
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:45,540
we have a safety glasses in
here. And, but and we have

1474
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,110
trailers and trucks, and we met.
So today we went and we have a

1475
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:52,560
couple customers, they have
sites and we say hey, you know,

1476
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,990
can we go out? And they're like,
absolutely. I mean, they're

1477
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:59,640
every time. Yeah, you know. And
the good news is, you know, we

1478
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,760
carry the insurance and
liability to it and the training

1479
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,850
were OSHA certified and or OSHA
training, excuse me, I don't

1480
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:08,880
think there's a certification.
But and we follow all their

1481
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,410
guidelines. And we product and
OSHA is the is the Occupational

1482
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,350
Safety and Health
Administration. They're the ones

1483
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,320
who would, would dictate that
when you're doing this activity

1484
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,020
that you have, and I won't show
you my shoes, but they're closed

1485
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:26,460
toed. Right. So composite or
steel toe, that when you're in

1486
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:26,550
the

1487
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:30,660
Audrow Nash: standards body for
worker safety correctively our

1488
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,820
worker conditions are something
okay.

1489
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,070
Charles Brian Quinn: And by by
joining and being there that

1490
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:39,120
they'll report on incidents and
things that are unsafe. Yeah,

1491
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,220
exactly. In order to understand
they're very big in

1492
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,170
construction, right. This is why
when you go to a construction

1493
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,500
site, if you're not wearing your
helmet, your hard hat, you know,

1494
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,130
you can OSHA can get you in
trouble. So But I digress a

1495
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:53,790
little bit, so we as
subcontractors we go out. And

1496
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,430
that's pretty critical for us.
But from a product standpoint,

1497
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,240
it's also No, but what we do is
when we go out and we do the

1498
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,930
work to be done with that's the
day after is usually when we do

1499
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:07,890
our releases will go and we say,
you know, we tried to push it

1500
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:10,320
before, we're like, oh, that's
just a small fix, let's just put

1501
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,110
it into production. The good
news is we can issue fixes

1502
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:15,990
pretty quick, like we've got a
system for doing that we can

1503
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:18,360
hotfix and do a branch off
stable and do a hotfix. And

1504
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,480
we've had to do this before, you
know, luckily, some of them

1505
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,450
aren't like critical, you know,
that the test suite will cup cut

1506
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,030
that out, right. But it might be
some small fix that gets out

1507
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:31,380
there. But in doing so by by
actually doing the job to be

1508
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,570
done. We are effectively and
experience, right. And we're

1509
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,690
making sure that what I would
call is sort of the eye it's

1510
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,960
it's more eyes on the bugs make
sort of bugs shallow, that's the

1511
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,290
cathedral bizarre approach,
right is that, you know, as our

1512
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:49,620
customers see these things, and
as we see them, like we can fix

1513
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:53,370
them. And so I tell our team,
you know, and we've strived to

1514
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:56,610
do this, but we strive to make
sure that we can release early

1515
01:23:56,610 --> 01:24:00,480
and often and quickly. And I
think that that is probably our

1516
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,960
kicker. So we even have DevOps,
time DevOps that just helps us

1517
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,870
with developer tooling,
developer happiness, logging,

1518
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,990
and making sure that our stuff
is just fast to go out. And I

1519
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,030
think that's just critical.
We'll just probably continue to

1520
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:15,780
build that practice internally.
But to answer your question, how

1521
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:18,810
do we know when it's ready to go
is when we feel comfortable, and

1522
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:21,330
we've used it ourselves, and
we've mowed lawns with it, and

1523
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,360
it still works, and it passes
all our tests. We package it up.

1524
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:28,860
And we what's interesting is
that we just do a release off

1525
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,940
stable. And we package it all
up, bump the version numbers and

1526
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,120
then hit go. And it
automatically deploys into all

1527
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,670
across our fleet. And so then
that's when we do our text

1528
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:40,980
message to the to the customers
and say, Hey, next time you turn

1529
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,690
it on, you know,

1530
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,820
Audrow Nash: these are the
changes that will be applied.

1531
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:45,660
Yeah. And most

1532
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,590
Charles Brian Quinn: of the
time, they're excited. They're

1533
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,660
like, Oh, cool. I asked for that
feature last week. And we're

1534
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,550
like, yep, there it is.

1535
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:56,310
Audrow Nash: That's awesome. Do
you I guess, how do you train

1536
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:59,070
people to use your system? Like,
how is it?

1537
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,560
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah,
right. Yeah. We're, we're

1538
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,590
venture backed, and so we're
very hands on. In fact, we'll we

1539
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:09,270
I've, I've hired some people who
are robotic technicians who

1540
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,530
speak English and Spanish better
Spanish than I than I do. And

1541
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,250
they go on site and are doing a
lot of that. And we're building

1542
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:21,390
up that practice as well. We
are, I'm a big fan of the quote,

1543
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:25,620
what is it good artists copy?
What is it emulate? Great

1544
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,940
artists feel? Oh, yeah. And so
what we did is I asked our

1545
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,130
customers, like, who has the
best training? And they said,

1546
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:34,560
you know, and I won't say who it
is, because we're gonna copy

1547
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,000
him. And, and I said, Great,
we're gonna do University. And I

1548
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,720
said, like, let's just, I mean,
honestly, I mean, I, we're not

1549
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,610
gonna steal everything, because
it's just totally different. But

1550
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:48,750
Audrow Nash: it's dropping the
decisions. Yeah. It's like, they

1551
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,910
did a lot of things through
iteration. You're just kind of

1552
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:52,380
grabbing that and starting
there.

1553
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,510
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah. And
honestly, I think hopefully,

1554
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:57,330
that will leverage and level up
the industry by not starting

1555
01:25:57,330 --> 01:26:02,280
from ground zero, right. And so
we have a very good training

1556
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,550
program that is very hands on.
And we've gotten very good at

1557
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:08,610
it. In fact, our I'm very proud
of the work that our team does,

1558
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,710
they've, they've delivered it
several times. In fact, when we

1559
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:13,560
first started, one of the things
we did that it was very unique

1560
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,350
was we did training before we
even had anything, which was

1561
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:19,680
awesome. We invited landscapers
to come train on what we had

1562
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,170
now. And they'd ask questions
like, Well, what do you do about

1563
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:25,800
and we're like, how to get to
the thing? Yeah, or, or we'd be

1564
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,410
like that we do it with them.
And then they'd be like, I'm

1565
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:32,760
confused by x. And we'd be like,
re explain that. Right. And so

1566
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,360
we did a lot. We've done a lot.
And so now if you were to go out

1567
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,990
with our gentleman, who does the
train one of our gentlemen, who

1568
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,870
does the training right now,
he's very good at it, and even

1569
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:46,020
does some really things that are
unique. Some of our investors

1570
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:48,810
have been in the green industry
for why a while and they talk

1571
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,840
about training, being very
specific, where you tell them

1572
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,460
what you're gonna tell them,
then you tell them, tell them

1573
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:57,240
tell them and then you tell them
why and then you told them, yes.

1574
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,180
And so we do a lot of that. And
then it's a lot of it is from

1575
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:04,680
example, and sort of building
on. So there's like a base case,

1576
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,410
like, what we do is we used to
kind of go into like safety and

1577
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:09,150
all sort of stuff. And we're
like, you know, what, just show

1578
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:13,740
the basic use case, then starts
talking about some of the things

1579
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:16,530
that could happen and trigger
those things to happen. And then

1580
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,690
the other thing we do that's
really nice, too, is that we

1581
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:21,780
trigger some some things like,
for instance, we very

1582
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,020
intentional about when we start
going we say oh, you know,

1583
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,320
something happened, he pauses
the MO or whatever. And then he

1584
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,920
says, What would you do, and we
have them call support. We have

1585
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,610
a 787 P support line, that's
text, message and phone. And

1586
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:39,450
that's staffed by our CIT level
one engineers, which is in some

1587
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:42,480
of us now, which is we all do
support. We all have shifts? And

1588
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,210
so we'll answer it and we'll
say, Oh, cool. Looks like you've

1589
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:48,150
got this. Thanks for calling.
You can call any time. The

1590
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:50,580
answer is this. We know what it
is hit resume, and you should be

1591
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,730
able to do it. And they go, Oh,
that was easy. And so we

1592
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:56,370
hopefully then they, you know,
because if we just showed up,

1593
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:58,980
and we're like, oh, you can call
support for anything. I mean,

1594
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:01,410
yeah, I do it. But if we have
them do it in a case where it's

1595
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:04,560
really easy, and it makes them
feel good. And we say thank you

1596
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,130
and do all these things. You
know, and then we're ready for

1597
01:28:08,130 --> 01:28:10,860
it that they go, Oh, well, that
was fun, you know, and then we

1598
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,930
also are watching. So we
congratulate him, like we'll

1599
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:16,290
send them a text and be like,
hey, great first map. It's kind

1600
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:19,920
of like they're in on the
project. That sounds thing. You

1601
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,820
nailed it. Yeah. And so it's,
I'm very proud of our training.

1602
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:26,940
And that's some of my background
was in a lot of that technical

1603
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:30,120
training, like making the
complex, simple. And so very

1604
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,730
proud of our work in that. And I
think we have a lot to do and a

1605
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,340
lot of work to do there. But
we're pretty good at it, I

1606
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:35,730
think.

1607
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,850
Audrow Nash: Yeah. How long? How
long does it take to train

1608
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:41,580
someone before they're up and
running?

1609
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:44,190
Charles Brian Quinn: It used? We
used to advocate for a couple of

1610
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:47,880
days. And I'd be surprised. I
think the last training we did,

1611
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:51,600
one of our guys shows up and
he's like, he's like they got it

1612
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:56,130
like after an hour. He's like,
Yeah, he's like, and so now what

1613
01:28:56,130 --> 01:29:00,030
we do is we hang out with them,
and help them because they need

1614
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:03,540
help. Yeah, just see if they
need any do site selection and

1615
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,690
stuff like that, which is crazy.
So we've gotten really good with

1616
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:10,500
the pre work and sort of pre
material. And then when we come

1617
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,320
on site, it's very quick. As you
can imagine, these are

1618
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,530
experienced operators. And we've
gotten some of the analogies

1619
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,350
very good like you you've done
and the system itself has gotten

1620
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,020
really simple. It's it's
basically an appliance right, so

1621
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:25,590
yeah, you know, there's one like
cruise control. I mean, yeah, I

1622
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:28,890
mean, they go when I got a new
car, they didn't train me on

1623
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:31,830
cruise control. I was just like,
Oh, there's the two buttons for

1624
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:35,850
it. Got it. Right. It's it's
trying to make it like that.

1625
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,580
Right. And I didn't used to be
like that used to be I mean, you

1626
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,890
used to watch us we'd have a
laptop and we'd be like,

1627
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,750
alright, yeah, Ross launch your
BBs open. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah,

1628
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:53,130
Audrow Nash: it's crazy. Okay.
So, how many of these do you

1629
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:57,480
have? Like how many mowers are I
actually I'm curious about the

1630
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,050
business model. So you're
venture backed at the moment but

1631
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,780
it will it be a subscription
based thing? Will people own

1632
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:08,340
these robots? Or how will it or
people, people own autonomous

1633
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,360
system in the mower?

1634
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:11,549
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah, I'm
happy to share all this, we're

1635
01:30:11,549 --> 01:30:14,069
pretty open book with almost
everything except for probably

1636
01:30:14,069 --> 01:30:16,349
my, if my employees are on a
pip, that's probably the only

1637
01:30:16,349 --> 01:30:18,839
thing I won't share and their
salary. What's that? A

1638
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:20,609
performance improvement plan,
that just means you're in

1639
01:30:20,609 --> 01:30:24,029
trouble. And so I think that the
joke is that I, we're pretty

1640
01:30:24,029 --> 01:30:26,609
open book about a lot of stuff
in our business, we're not like

1641
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:29,909
a stealth mode startup, and we
never have been. So it's just

1642
01:30:29,909 --> 01:30:34,019
easier to just be open on it is,
you don't have to remember what

1643
01:30:34,019 --> 01:30:37,289
you told people. And so for our
business model, currently, we're

1644
01:30:37,289 --> 01:30:41,219
trying to meet our customers
with how they pay, or how they

1645
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:44,579
charge. And so knowing is a
seasonal business. And when you

1646
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:48,419
think about seasonal workers,
and robotic workers, there's a

1647
01:30:48,419 --> 01:30:51,209
cost associated with those
workers. If I wanted to have a

1648
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:55,379
worker, you know, I might pay
them a yearly, you know, you

1649
01:30:55,379 --> 01:30:57,869
think about the cost and years
because a lot of these companies

1650
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,599
that do commercial have these
contracts that last for a year,

1651
01:31:00,599 --> 01:31:03,299
and they're like, Okay, we're
gonna need, you know, X ray

1652
01:31:03,299 --> 01:31:06,029
people on this crew and Right,
exactly, well, 3d, we're on this

1653
01:31:06,029 --> 01:31:10,739
crew, right. And so our costs
are pretty simple, in that we

1654
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:16,169
charge how our customers pay how
they get paid. And so it's a one

1655
01:31:16,169 --> 01:31:20,339
monthly fee for our software.
Now, the the mower itself is,

1656
01:31:20,339 --> 01:31:23,009
like I said, upfitted. And so
what's great about that, though,

1657
01:31:23,009 --> 01:31:26,639
is that the manufacturer is able
to do that. And what's great

1658
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,699
about that is that they've been
able to put their procurement in

1659
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:32,459
their economies of scale on
these things. So I guarantee you

1660
01:31:32,459 --> 01:31:34,889
that they're getting better
pricing on a Hall Effect

1661
01:31:34,919 --> 01:31:39,809
encoder, from, you know, from
Honeywell than we were able to

1662
01:31:39,809 --> 01:31:42,389
get, right? Because when when we
call, we're like, can we get

1663
01:31:42,449 --> 01:31:46,499
100? And they're like, you know,
and when they call, they're

1664
01:31:46,499 --> 01:31:50,729
like, can we get 50,000? And by
the way, here's our procurement

1665
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:54,089
person, and we probably already
ordered from you anyway. And

1666
01:31:54,089 --> 01:31:56,099
they're like, Great, yeah, we
can add that to your next order.

1667
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:59,579
And so there is some new stuff,
but you know, they've obviously

1668
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:02,489
gotten better pricing on that.
And again, more manufacturers

1669
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:07,049
and OEM producers are better at
the storing and producing of

1670
01:32:07,049 --> 01:32:10,259
that equipment at the facility
where they do it. And so we

1671
01:32:10,259 --> 01:32:12,569
don't we, you know, we don't
have a big manufacturing

1672
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:13,619
facility where we do

1673
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,650
Audrow Nash: you don't need it,
you just do the software, and

1674
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,560
the testing and sensor suites,
like, figuring it

1675
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,660
Charles Brian Quinn: out
exactly. And and constantly

1676
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:24,330
iterating on on the next
generation and our sort of what

1677
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:28,410
we call upgrades and field.
Right. And so yeah, so in terms

1678
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:31,290
of charging the business model,
I would not be surprised if we

1679
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:34,290
move to a robotics as a service.
And I know that's a pretty

1680
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:38,760
popular route to call it. And
some of our customers are asking

1681
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,490
for it. So we would love to work
with some of our partners on

1682
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:43,470
doing that. Could you imagine a
day where if you're a

1683
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:47,790
landscaper, and you say hey, I
know from May to October, or

1684
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:50,730
April to October, you know,
however many months that is 878

1685
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:54,900
months? And we said what if we
could give you a mower and a

1686
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:59,070
robotic worker that lives on
that mower? For one fee, and

1687
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:03,180
2500 I'm making up a number I'm
on and they go, that's a dang

1688
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:05,490
good deal. Because, you know,
like, if you think about the

1689
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:08,340
person and the mower, and they
start to do the math, and

1690
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,430
they're like, whoa, that's like,
you know, six or seven an hour

1691
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:15,180
in terms of labor, and we're
like, great, you know, like not

1692
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:18,150
to be coy or anything. But like
that said, you know, you can't

1693
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:20,700
hire person for that. I mean, no
person would want to work for

1694
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:24,060
seven an hour, right? But a
robotic worker, and also it

1695
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,160
Audrow Nash: can work through
the heat and all the like, and

1696
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,390
also won't get tired

1697
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:29,819
Charles Brian Quinn: quality.
Yeah. And And also, we do get

1698
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:33,479
pushback because they're like,
Well, what about in January,

1699
01:33:33,509 --> 01:33:36,089
like right now when you know,
some of our customers only known

1700
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:39,089
a little bit or not at all, if
they're in the Northeast, and I

1701
01:33:39,089 --> 01:33:41,969
go, Well, what do you do now?
And they're like, you know, fire

1702
01:33:41,969 --> 01:33:44,549
them or get seasonal workers or
have them do something else? And

1703
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:48,059
I'm like, well, guess what, your
robotic worker on your mower on

1704
01:33:48,059 --> 01:33:52,469
March 1, is ready to mow? And
you know, even if you put him on

1705
01:33:52,469 --> 01:33:55,379
the shelf, you know, put him
aside and weatherize they'll be

1706
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:59,129
ready to move. And yeah, guess
what he's gotten like 50 updates

1707
01:33:59,129 --> 01:34:02,489
since then. Yeah, is better. And
like has more features and

1708
01:34:02,489 --> 01:34:04,799
functionality from all these
people we were known in Florida

1709
01:34:04,799 --> 01:34:07,799
has been training in the OFF
time. Exactly. Robotic workers.

1710
01:34:07,829 --> 01:34:10,619
Yeah. And what's cool is that
they don't get it yet until they

1711
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:13,859
see it and experience it. And
then they're like, Wow, they're

1712
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:17,519
like, this is software. Like,
I've got software on my mower,

1713
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,729
and a robotic worker that's
continually getting better. And

1714
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:22,979
it's hard to see, like, you
know, it's hard to tell

1715
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:25,799
somebody, but when they see it,
and experience it, they get

1716
01:34:25,799 --> 01:34:28,919
really, like addicted to it,
right. So our early customers

1717
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:31,799
are, are gonna win big because
they've been early adopters. And

1718
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:34,169
they've seen us through some of
the challenges of things, but

1719
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:37,079
they've also experienced some
pretty big wins. And so I think

1720
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:39,509
that business model will
continue, but I'm also open to

1721
01:34:39,509 --> 01:34:42,179
changing it, you know, like
we're very, very customer

1722
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:45,479
oriented, customer focused and
obsessed. And so if they need

1723
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:48,719
something else, we'll do it for
them. You know, and I think that

1724
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,949
the, we are we are taking we are
using a lot of capital right now

1725
01:34:52,949 --> 01:34:56,639
to do speed and to shore up and
so like, you know, when the

1726
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,519
customer asked for something, we
just do it. And when we hit

1727
01:34:59,519 --> 01:35:01,589
those economies To scale, I
think we'll have those general

1728
01:35:01,589 --> 01:35:04,409
SAS margins that are pretty
high, when we're just delivering

1729
01:35:04,409 --> 01:35:07,829
a service. And we don't have to
go out and do training and you

1730
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:10,439
know, all that other stuff,
which is we're on the path

1731
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:11,129
towards doing.

1732
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:15,150
Audrow Nash: Yeah. What do you
so you said that this is you've

1733
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:17,670
always been bootstrapping in the
past. And this is the first time

1734
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:21,240
you're taking venture capital.
Would you tell me a bit about

1735
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,390
your experience with this? And
oh, yeah, just talk on it for a

1736
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:24,600
bit.

1737
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:27,810
Charles Brian Quinn: I love
both. I think that there's room

1738
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,800
and time to do both. I think, if
you don't have to raise money,

1739
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,370
you shouldn't. You know, it is I
think there's a very good use

1740
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:39,270
cases, when you're doing
something is funny. My co

1741
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:43,110
founder, David is really funny.
He's, he's an interesting guy.

1742
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,990
And he has a quote that I'll
repeat, he says, you know,

1743
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,750
starting a business is hard.
There's all kinds of challenges

1744
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:52,800
people business, the the market,
you know, there's timing,

1745
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,140
there's all kinds of stuff he's
like, so if the whole thing is

1746
01:35:55,140 --> 01:36:00,510
hard, anyway, why not just start
a big one? Right. And I and I

1747
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:03,660
was like, You're right, right?
Like, you know, why not? He's

1748
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:06,390
like, why not just go after
something massive, like that's,

1749
01:36:06,570 --> 01:36:11,400
you know, huge and impactful and
game changing. And, you know,

1750
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,470
it's funny, because that's kind
of his investment thesis, right?

1751
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:18,360
Like, he won't invest in like,
gambling or whatever, you know,

1752
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,120
like, it's just not, you know,
it's like a bootstrap. Yeah, it

1753
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:25,590
has to be big. And, and so it's,
and so there's a time and place

1754
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:28,980
for that now, bootstrapping, I
absolutely love because there's

1755
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:33,120
something brilliant and amazing
about selling something,

1756
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:37,740
delivering it, getting paid, and
using that money to grow. And

1757
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:40,260
I've done that, and and, you
know, you know, service

1758
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:43,860
businesses are great for that,
you know, restaurants would be

1759
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:46,410
good for that, you know, where
you're just building one and

1760
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:48,900
then use the profits from one
that go to the another and some

1761
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:51,270
robotics companies could
probably, you know, do that

1762
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,500
through some model. But if you
are going after something big,

1763
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,010
and there's a leap of faith,
more, there's a lot of things

1764
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:03,090
that have to happen, and a lot
of bets that you are capable of

1765
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:05,550
doing and know like if you know
something that the rest of the

1766
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,890
world doesn't, and I do and I
happen to know, and that is that

1767
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:10,980
I think software is going to eat
the outdoor power equipment

1768
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:15,600
industry, and totally the most
powerful thing on these devices,

1769
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:21,180
then then I would, I personally
would pay a lot of money now to

1770
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:24,330
be the operating system of the
future. And so I'll trade

1771
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:28,650
today's dollars, hands down
tomorrow's. And so that's what

1772
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:33,420
Yeah, and so placing a bet very
heavily. Oh, yeah. And what's

1773
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:37,260
what's interesting is, is the
mindset shift from going from

1774
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:42,480
Bootstrap to venture has been
tough for me. Because in the

1775
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,550
Bootstrap, you know, a lot of
questions I would ask would be

1776
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:47,550
like, how do we pay for that.
And, you know, like, right now,

1777
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,310
like next month, or the, you
know, in 90 days, net 90, when,

1778
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:53,160
when, when bills are due, you
want to stay positive the whole

1779
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,610
time, basically, right. And, and
now, what I'm doing is I'm

1780
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:01,740
constantly, I'm constantly
trying to build a valuable

1781
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:05,850
company and an asset. And I use
that using capital. And so I do

1782
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:10,230
a lot of things that are hard
that scale and doing a lot of

1783
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:13,230
things that are very unscalable.
Now to prove that is scalable

1784
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:16,170
later. And what I mean by that
is like, we eventually would

1785
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,050
like for manufacturers, sorry
for the outdoor equipment

1786
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:23,160
dealers to do a lot of the fixes
for us. And so what I do is I go

1787
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,070
above and beyond to make sure
that it is easy, and that

1788
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:28,950
they're incentivized to do it.
And so I pay, you know, more

1789
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,620
than their sort of normal rate,
so that they're not, they don't

1790
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,590
feel like, Oh, who's this
company? And why are they asking

1791
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,980
me to like, put a new camera on
here. And I'm like, Hey, like, I

1792
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:40,680
want you to, you know, I'm going
to use my venture dollars to

1793
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,590
make to figure this out and get
better at it.

1794
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,200
Audrow Nash: So you get lots of
feedback from them, so you can

1795
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,570
improve the process, and
eventually, it will be less

1796
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:53,100
painful thing for future ones.
Think. Interesting. Don't see

1797
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:53,490
where

1798
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:55,410
Charles Brian Quinn: I'm sure
I've, yeah, go ahead. I was

1799
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:57,450
gonna say, and bootstrapping
adventure, I'm sure there's a

1800
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:59,310
lot more people who can talk
more about it. And I know we're

1801
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,320
running out of time, and I'm
happy to go into way more

1802
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,930
detail. But I also don't know
too much. I'm still fumbling

1803
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:06,600
along as I go. I wouldn't say
that I've mastered it, we have

1804
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,510
raised quite a bit of funds. And
every time I tell my friends,

1805
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:13,260
I'm like, Oh, I'm just not good
at this. They're like, look at

1806
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,290
the results seem to be doing
okay, but I guess I'm harder on

1807
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:19,080
myself than I am on on anybody
else. Right. So.

1808
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:25,050
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Let's see.
So we're a little over the

1809
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,780
scheduled time is Are you okay
to talk a little longer? Yeah.

1810
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:34,650
Okay. I would love to hear more
about your, your bootstrap

1811
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,860
bootstrapping experience. And
then kind of like if there's

1812
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:41,430
anything that you have learned
there that you can bring to this

1813
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:44,100
venture capital experience.

1814
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:47,820
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah. So
fundamentally, the the impact

1815
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:51,150
the differences of like building
a business that is bootstrapped

1816
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,660
meaning we had sold a product,
deliver that product, get paid

1817
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:58,560
and then repeat versus the
venture which is, in my mind,

1818
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,770
could be something like that,
but it's It's probably trading a

1819
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:04,890
lot of it's basically going
into, like what I would call a

1820
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:08,520
negative sort of, if you look
at, I guess the best way to

1821
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:13,050
describe it is, there's a cost
of acquisition for each customer

1822
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:16,200
that can get rather large. And
so at some point, you're

1823
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,290
basically see this thing where
it looks like your company is

1824
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:22,980
just burning money. And every
new customer you acquire causes

1825
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:25,800
you to take this, we call it the
J curve. And David Scott talks a

1826
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,960
lot about this, he talks about
recurring revenue businesses,

1827
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,620
that J curve goes way down. And
every time you do it, it really

1828
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:34,200
just looks like you're just
burning cash. But what's the

1829
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,430
neat part? Is it that some point
that Jay, you know, can do this

1830
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:40,500
and every recurring business,
you know, a lot of people are

1831
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,600
like, well, so and so doesn't
make any money. And you're like,

1832
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,600
well, that's not really the best
way right now. Right? Correct.

1833
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:48,330
Because they're creating these
economies of scale. And every

1834
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:52,380
customer they acquire, it might
cost 12 grand to acquire that

1835
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:57,330
customer. But every year, they
make 12 grand, and the margin on

1836
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:00,630
that 12 grand the profit on that
12 grand is very high, the

1837
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:03,750
marginal dollars you do once you
acquire them. And then they also

1838
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:06,450
don't think about net expansion,
which is where each customer

1839
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:09,390
might add more, right? So you've
cost to acquire the network,

1840
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:12,510
Audrow Nash: that kind of thing,
right? So it gets exponentially

1841
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:14,370
better to use the service or
something.

1842
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:16,890
Charles Brian Quinn: And so what
I would say is that the lessons

1843
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:19,620
that I learned bootstrapping,
were just the basic ones, like I

1844
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:23,040
still rely on a lot of them,
like how do I build a good

1845
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:30,210
culture? How do I hire retain?
How do I fire people? You know,

1846
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,280
that I don't like talking about
that. But you know, it's

1847
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,260
something that you know, you
have to do to put the right

1848
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:39,810
people on the bus and all those
lessons I learned using our own

1849
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:42,990
money, like I have to do now
even though I have venture

1850
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:45,660
money, I still do that. Right.
Like, and I think that that's

1851
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:48,060
where I think you've talked
about it a lot. The analogy I

1852
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,010
think you gave in the
agriculture one is that like too

1853
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:53,220
much money can mess you up,
right? If you don't have any

1854
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:57,000
constraints, like that can be
terrible. So one of the things

1855
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,220
that we've done differently in
venture and maybe this will turn

1856
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:03,930
out to be a dumb, dumb move. But
I have raised sequentially, sort

1857
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:08,100
of small incremental rounds, as
opposed to giant ones. And so we

1858
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:11,520
don't like advertise, like, oh,
we raised 16 million, like we've

1859
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,270
never raised a $6 million round.
And we've done that, because

1860
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:17,850
even though we take a little bit
of dilution on that, like, what

1861
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:21,810
I've said is that, in
bootstrapping, I have built a

1862
01:42:21,810 --> 01:42:26,430
grape. And I've eaten the grape,
right? And so grape is pretty

1863
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:31,200
good. But if you're hungry, it's
cool to build a watermelon and

1864
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,690
eat a slice. And so when you
think about that, like, that's

1865
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:35,580
what we're doing with green tea
and venture backed is that,

1866
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:38,460
would you rather have a full
grape? Or would you rather have

1867
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:41,190
a slice of a watermelon? And by
the way, the other slices all go

1868
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:45,570
to investors, and people who are
actively taking risk with you.

1869
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:47,850
And you know, and we've done a
really good job, I think of

1870
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:51,840
recruiting in on our cap table,
we call it, you know, our

1871
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,910
Audrow Nash: investor
capitalization table. Yeah,

1872
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:56,340
Charles Brian Quinn: they're all
people who are green industry,

1873
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,910
robotics, distributors, dealers,
also our various

1874
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:01,860
Audrow Nash: Smart Money,
basically, yeah.

1875
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,190
Charles Brian Quinn: I call him
and I'm like, Hey, how many

1876
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:07,170
mowers were sold in there? And
they're like, Well, you know,

1877
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:09,390
you're not supposed to know
this, that. But here you go. And

1878
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,360
they don't say that. They say,
actually, here's what I can tell

1879
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,150
you. And here's what I know. And
here's, here's this, and here's

1880
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:17,340
what you need to talk to. And
here's seven other connections.

1881
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:20,070
And, you know, call me later.
And I'll have that for you. And

1882
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:22,830
I've been thinking about this,
and they are proactive, and so

1883
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,260
we have a very good, that's the
other thing that I think is

1884
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:28,020
unique is that we're bringing
along a lot of people with us,

1885
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,980
which is really fun. To me,
there's, there's a bit of, and

1886
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,620
what's cool, too, is I'm lucky
in that I was able to

1887
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:37,290
participate in some of our
rounds, which is rare. I think,

1888
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:40,620
for an entrepreneur, I have had
some some success before. And

1889
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:43,830
so, and I always bet on myself.
So I lead one of the rounds,

1890
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:46,320
which is kind of fun, you know,
to say, Okay,

1891
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,090
Audrow Nash: what does it mean?
What does it mean? You let

1892
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:50,820
around was it mean, you're the
person that goes around talking

1893
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,050
and trying to raise investment.

1894
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,370
Charles Brian Quinn: So I'm
always trying to go around and

1895
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,830
raise investment, that's
actually my job as CEO. So I'm

1896
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:59,190
gonna do it for what for this
round, I went to my, with my

1897
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:02,970
investors and said, Hey, things
are looking really well for the

1898
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:06,090
company. I believe that we have
hit our next milestone, because

1899
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:09,480
we did. And I said, I'm leading
this next round, meaning I'm

1900
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:12,180
putting in a million dollars in
my own money on this next round.

1901
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,160
Yeah. And I think we need this
and does anybody want to come in

1902
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:21,840
with me? And the fun part about
that is what happens is that I

1903
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:26,430
didn't get to put in a million.
I only put in half that but the

1904
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,690
there's all SEC D regulation,
you go look it up. So I'm not

1905
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:33,960
like I'm bragging about it or
anything. But yeah, you know, so

1906
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:37,710
so, but I did get to be the
largest investor in that and

1907
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:40,020
then the reason it went down is
because all my other investors

1908
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:43,200
were like, I'm in put me down
for more, you know, like, we're

1909
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:47,190
in with you let's go and and
and, and they aren't always like

1910
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:48,990
that, you know, a lot of them
are like, hey, like, these

1911
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:52,230
metrics are bad. Like, you need
more you know, this, you need

1912
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:54,480
more that? Yeah, they're
prioritizing something

1913
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,960
different, but it is good that I
do have an investor cap table

1914
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,080
that does believe in us and
we've had the For sure that will

1915
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:04,200
up. And we've been able to
recruit others as well. But that

1916
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:08,490
is a that is a fun game that I
am not good at yet. But I have

1917
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:12,240
gotten better at it through
failure. And the last the last

1918
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:16,020
round was very good. And we
raised $4 million. Very excited

1919
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:19,020
by that. Thank you. We didn't
really I'm not very good at

1920
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,090
publicizing those things,
because I'm just not good at it.

1921
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:25,110
And I honestly think it's kind
of like taking on debt. And what

1922
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:27,450
do you mean? I don't I don't
understand. It's kind of like we

1923
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:30,690
take on this capital. And now we
have to utilize it, spend it

1924
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:34,710
wisely. So I don't know. I do
think there's there's something

1925
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:37,380
to be said for celebrating and
always helping your customers.

1926
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:38,910
And so if there's a way to
phrase it, that helps your

1927
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:42,240
customers, but I'm just not big
on the current Zeitgeist right

1928
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,270
now, where we're like, raising
is the thing. Like, it's funny,

1929
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:47,040
because the thing that I would
like to celebrate, and we

1930
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:51,060
celebrate more internally is
like, happy customers, you know,

1931
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:53,370
sales and that kind of stuff.
And so that's not really like

1932
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:55,320
celebrated, we don't like a lot
of companies don't say like, we

1933
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:58,050
just sold a million dollars.
Like, yeah, that should be

1934
01:45:58,050 --> 01:46:00,480
celebrated probably more than
the current raises, because

1935
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,000
raises just mean that, you know,

1936
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:06,360
Audrow Nash: raises you mean
higher valuation and raising

1937
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,170
heavy rounds.

1938
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:09,660
Charles Brian Quinn: Yeah. And
and also they without context,

1939
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,460
they don't really mean anything,
right? Like, yes,

1940
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,290
Audrow Nash: it's just a lot of
people don't share, you know,

1941
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:15,660
the dilution, and they might
have been on unfavorable terms.

1942
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,240
Like there's a lot of context
necessary, I

1943
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,490
Charles Brian Quinn: believe.
And good news is, you know, I

1944
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:22,890
can't I won't disclose I won't
disclose some of this because

1945
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:26,160
not mine to disclose, but we
have very good, very good terms

1946
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,260
on our raise. Very simple.
There's not a lot of funny,

1947
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:29,760
Craps and convertible,

1948
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:33,060
Audrow Nash: no lights, crazy,
veto power. Any event,

1949
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:33,480
sometimes.

1950
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:37,050
Charles Brian Quinn: My see my
co founder is has is the most

1951
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,510
entrepreneur friendly, I think
it's gonna come out that he is

1952
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:43,740
and he's had the Midas touch. I
think just recently, he's got a

1953
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:48,060
couple companies that are worth
billions. And so wow. I mean,

1954
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:51,630
he's super entrepreneur
friendly. And so it's crazy how

1955
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:54,630
entrepreneur friendly is, in
fact, he's so friendly, on times

1956
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:56,760
that he's just like, we'll just
what do you want to do? That it

1957
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,220
actually makes it makes people
like me who have high

1958
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:03,720
responsibility go, will shoot he
just gave me all theirs. I

1959
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,770
better make this a win. Good.
Fair. Yeah. Yeah. And I think

1960
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:10,500
that that's neat that I've
learned that about really good

1961
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,000
venture is that they,

1962
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,610
Audrow Nash: you know, it's
funny people talk you want to

1963
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:17,880
help us succeed. Yeah, rather
than just they want to take the

1964
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,190
maximum cut. Yeah, and kind of
screw you it's

1965
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:21,690
Charles Brian Quinn: been an
entrepreneur too. So with that

1966
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:24,570
also is a nicety. You know,
having been in those shoes,

1967
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:27,930
personally, I can't do it. I'm
you'll never find me being an

1968
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:31,020
investor. I'm terrible at it.
I've done it done a little bit,

1969
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:33,780
but I'm just not good at it. I
like being in the in the in the

1970
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,890
driver's ed arena.

1971
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:37,710
Audrow Nash: You're betting on
yourself? Yeah. Yeah, I see.

1972
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:42,990
What do you think is the the
future? Like when you look out?

1973
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:47,400
Next year, two years, five
years? Where do you see green z

1974
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:47,820
going?

1975
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,640
Charles Brian Quinn: Ah, well,
we just did a couple of our

1976
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:54,390
vision planning. I'm very big on
goals and goal setting. I have I

1977
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:57,180
just looked at my personal goals
from five years ago back that I

1978
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:01,770
wrote in 2016. And I think it's
incredible. That, you know, Bill

1979
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:04,530
Gates said it, I think the quote
is true to him. He said, People

1980
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:07,800
underestimate what they can do
in 10 years, they overestimate

1981
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:12,150
what they can do in one. And so
I'm a big fan of writing your

1982
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:15,090
your goals and the vision, and
there's a way to do it. And so

1983
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:20,460
if we look, five years out,
green tea, and again, that the

1984
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,830
name is actually interesting,
and it may be that green tea is

1985
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:25,620
the product just for green. And
who knows, I mean, not gonna be

1986
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,500
Audrow Nash: eventually I mean,
it's the same kind of, like, you

1987
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:31,710
can follow this model in a lot
of areas, I imagine. Right now

1988
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:32,610
you're making mowing.

1989
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:35,220
Charles Brian Quinn: But if you
go back to what I told you that

1990
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:38,520
our big mission is to free
humans from repetitive outdoor

1991
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:41,280
labor. And that is always been
the case. And we will continue

1992
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,190
to do that. I just learned the
other day that there's even self

1993
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:48,030
driving trucks get dirty, and 18
wheelers and something they pay

1994
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,950
some people to go to these
things where they park them and

1995
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:53,400
then they just do this the up
and down spray to spray them

1996
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,380
with like, you know, to clean
the wheels and stuff that's

1997
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:58,500
highly repetitive outdoor. And I
think it needs to be automated

1998
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,590
because I think we humans are
not made to get carpal tunnel

1999
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:04,740
doing this within Oh, yeah. Are
they are made to do is say hey,

2000
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:07,380
this needs to be clean. And hey,
that one doesn't need to and you

2001
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:08,400
know, hey, you know,

2002
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,200
Audrow Nash: I'm better all the
decision making all this other

2003
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,010
fun, high level.

2004
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,730
Charles Brian Quinn: So I
believe that green tea in five

2005
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:19,650
years will be helping free
humans from repetitive outdoor

2006
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:22,830
labor. And we'll do that for as
long as it takes. And I think

2007
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:25,380
that that's a big noble task.
It's going to take a long time.

2008
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:28,620
And so a lot of people always
ask are you for sale? And the

2009
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:31,140
answer is no, we're not for
sale. But how much

2010
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:34,830
Audrow Nash: use you started in
2018. With bangzi Is it correct?

2011
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:36,930
Yeah, that's awesome. You're
already getting questions about

2012
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:37,920
that. Well, I

2013
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,300
Charles Brian Quinn: mean,
everybody does, right. I mean,

2014
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:42,420
yeah, at least when you sort of
talk to them. Yeah. Big big

2015
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,880
people or big players or
partners and things like that.

2016
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:47,940
But yeah, you know, the answer
is no, but how much we

2017
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:52,500
everything's for sale except for
my boy. Right. So, but But the

2018
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:57,570
big thing that they have to
answer is is will they help us

2019
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,820
in our mission to free humans
from repetitive labor in the

2020
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,610
answer No, then it's not even on
the table. It's not Yeah.

2021
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:08,790
Gotcha. So So if we were to, to,
to sell, to merge to buy to

2022
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:11,790
acquire other companies, they
have to be in support of that

2023
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:15,000
mission and that big mission to
free humans from repetitive

2024
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,990
outdoor labor. And if they are,
let's go, let's do it. So I see

2025
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:21,750
us continuing to do that. And I
don't know where it'll take us,

2026
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:24,600
I think we're small. And so we
do a lot of short term planning,

2027
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:28,950
we do quarterly OKRs and
objective key results. And, and

2028
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:31,500
we shoot for we have a yearly
goal. And we have some big

2029
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,770
yearly goals, company objectives
that we go for, we have a three

2030
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:37,230
year plan to be very
specifically on more mower

2031
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:41,580
manufacturers, possibly in other
turf areas, other sort of

2032
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:45,360
platforms. And so I see us doing
that, I have a couple other

2033
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,330
things that probably are more
internal and not really exciting

2034
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:52,770
to share. But I see that, and I
see us also being a big members

2035
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:56,430
of the community, I would love
to see us open source more and,

2036
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:59,370
and I just think that, you know,
some of the work we're doing is

2037
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:01,890
just doesn't just needs to be
out there. And I'd be happy to

2038
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:04,650
continue to contribute. I'm a
huge fan of open source. I've

2039
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:07,320
been doing it my entire life. So
it's awesome. It's game

2040
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:07,740
changing,

2041
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:12,810
Audrow Nash: for sure. Last
thing, before asking for links

2042
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:16,380
and things. What advice would
you give to someone who's just

2043
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:17,430
starting their career?

2044
01:51:17,969 --> 01:51:23,819
Charles Brian Quinn: Mm hmm. I'm
not good at this. My I've had co

2045
01:51:23,819 --> 01:51:28,019
founders, my, my last co founder
was very good at giving advice.

2046
01:51:28,019 --> 01:51:33,779
And I think he even has a famous
blog article on it. So on the

2047
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:36,149
career, I think it's funny, a
lot of people will tell you, I

2048
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:38,849
can only speak from experience.
So let's just say that I'm not

2049
01:51:38,849 --> 01:51:41,129
good at giving advice. That's
what kind of what I try and do.

2050
01:51:41,129 --> 01:51:45,809
I'm not very good at it either.
But I would say that finding

2051
01:51:46,049 --> 01:51:51,299
something you love is dumb. You
know, like, you know, when I

2052
01:51:51,299 --> 01:51:56,099
think at certain levels, you
should strive to work hard and

2053
01:51:56,099 --> 01:52:02,339
learn. And, and, and not make,
you know, not not do this thing

2054
01:52:02,339 --> 01:52:04,469
where they're like, if you do
the work you love, you'll never

2055
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:06,899
work a day in your life. I was
like, man, if you do the work,

2056
01:52:06,899 --> 01:52:09,659
if you do something you love,
you're gonna hate it is the

2057
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:12,329
biggest way to like destroy,
you're like, I love tennis,

2058
01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:13,829
you're like, I'm gonna become a
tennis instructor. And now

2059
01:52:13,829 --> 01:52:18,959
you're gonna be like, tennis,
for my French. But yeah, the. So

2060
01:52:18,989 --> 01:52:21,479
I think career advice for
somebody starting out is get out

2061
01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:25,889
there, just do something, like,
do something big and do the

2062
01:52:25,889 --> 01:52:29,249
worst tasks that someone doesn't
want to do. You know, like, what

2063
01:52:29,249 --> 01:52:31,559
that means is like, okay, so if
you want to go into finance,

2064
01:52:31,559 --> 01:52:36,239
great, go figure out how to, you
know, make more Bitcoin money

2065
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:39,359
off somebody else who doesn't
own Bitcoin, that's fine. That's

2066
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:43,919
not for me, I don't think that's
very exciting. I would say find

2067
01:52:43,949 --> 01:52:47,549
a company that's doing something
noble or good or sustainable.

2068
01:52:47,729 --> 01:52:50,369
And then go do the worst thing
in it, like, go do customer

2069
01:52:50,369 --> 01:52:54,539
support, right? Like, you know,
like, or work the, you know, the

2070
01:52:54,539 --> 01:52:59,069
worst job. And if you're useful
and good, you will learn and you

2071
01:52:59,069 --> 01:53:01,859
will move quickly. You know,
there's plenty of examples of

2072
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:04,199
people who've worked in the
mailroom of the CEO. And it

2073
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:07,409
happens all the time. I have
good friends who, you know,

2074
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:09,509
worked in businesses who are
CEOs now and people are like,

2075
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:11,999
Oh, how did you do that? And
it's like, well, overnight, it's

2076
01:53:11,999 --> 01:53:15,239
like, no, of course, not
overnight. You know, they did

2077
01:53:15,239 --> 01:53:18,689
something hard and learned and,
and jumped in and did it and,

2078
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:21,389
and weren't afraid to say this
is hard. And what I'm doing is

2079
01:53:21,389 --> 01:53:24,479
hard. And it may take a little
while. And that's easy for me to

2080
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:28,799
say because I'm sort of older
and having done that. But yeah,

2081
01:53:28,799 --> 01:53:32,609
I mean, I worked as a consultant
for a long time traveling, you

2082
01:53:32,609 --> 01:53:36,029
know, Monday through Thursday,
working in really weird

2083
01:53:36,089 --> 01:53:39,269
locations, but it was the amount
of learning I could think back

2084
01:53:39,269 --> 01:53:42,359
on that it was able to help me
do to build good products for

2085
01:53:42,359 --> 01:53:46,679
good customers and do things.
It's just, it's, it's amazing.

2086
01:53:47,009 --> 01:53:50,009
So I don't have any good advice
for career you could skip this

2087
01:53:50,009 --> 01:53:54,779
section. You know, it's very
valuable. Go do something noble

2088
01:53:54,779 --> 01:53:59,189
and hard and boring and, and
learn whatever you can from it.

2089
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:00,119
That's my advice.

2090
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:01,350
Audrow Nash: Love that. Oh,
yeah.

2091
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:05,100
Charles Brian Quinn: Last thing
is do you have any links or

2092
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,590
contact info or anything that
you'd like to share with our

2093
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:11,610
listeners? Absolutely. So
Twitter is our more developer

2094
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:15,570
robotics focused, pithy jokes,
and shout outs to Ross. So

2095
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:18,960
that's where we sort of do that.
YouTube is pretty good. We have

2096
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,240
a series called how it works.
That's actually pretty good even

2097
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,970
for roboticist and sort of non
roboticists, which I know is

2098
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:27,090
your audience sort of emerging.
We share a lot about how the

2099
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:30,240
product works, which landscapers
really love. And so that's

2100
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:32,340
booting back up in series. We
used to do one a month we've

2101
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:35,490
sort of tailed off in December
we to do one, we're back on that

2102
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:39,300
schedule and committed to it
goal setting. And so we'll be

2103
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,850
doing a bunch of those YouTube
videos. I'd say that our YouTube

2104
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:45,270
channels fun. We went viral on
tick tock, although that's

2105
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:47,430
probably not going to go look at
that. We have like a couple of

2106
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:49,980
YouTube videos with like
millions of views which is nuts.

2107
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:54,420
Wow. That is nuts. Yeah, I don't
understand that one. And

2108
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:57,570
Instagram is really good for if
you're a landscaper and you want

2109
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:59,310
to see how the product works.
We're constantly posting stuff

2110
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:03,060
from the field. Then like actual
mowing, and actual usage of the

2111
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:06,480
of the robot, which I think is
really fun and good. But yeah,

2112
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,940
all those channels are good. And
our website, you know, it

2113
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:10,950
doesn't get updated that often.
But you can definitely go there.

2114
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:13,410
If you're interested in careers,
we, you know, definitely go

2115
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:17,010
there. And I think LinkedIn, I
haven't figured out yet I need

2116
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:19,710
to get better at that one of my
investors is very good at that.

2117
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:23,760
And I need to ask them to do it.
So. But yeah, go to green Z,

2118
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:26,670
green z.com, where get green Z
or green Z on most channels, you

2119
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:30,660
can find us and I think that's
it. Yeah, I mean, I think we

2120
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:33,810
have some open source tool on
GitHub. One of our path planners

2121
01:55:33,810 --> 01:55:38,370
is out there. It's good for
research. For coverage. We did

2122
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,280
one of the papers and kind of
improved it. So you're happy to

2123
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,620
do that. We have some fun stuff
that we're gonna open source

2124
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:46,950
soon on the newer one that we
did. So we don't maintain that

2125
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:48,780
one. Unfortunately, if somebody
like to pick up the maintaining

2126
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,760
on that date, they're welcome to
but we have some really other

2127
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,330
fun stuff.

2128
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,330
Audrow Nash: So all right.
Awesome.

2129
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,640
Charles Brian Quinn: Thank you.
Thank you for having me. Cheers.

2130
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:02,850
Audrow Nash: Cheers. Thanks for
listening to this conversation

2131
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:07,410
with CPQ. Thank you again to our
founding sponsor, open robotics,

2132
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,850
and I hope to see you next time
